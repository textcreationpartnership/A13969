            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable, his verie good Lord, Sir <hi>Thomas Cicil</hi> Knight, Baron of Burghley, her Maiesties Lieutenant in the county of Yorke, and President of her highnes councel established in the North parts: Grace, mercy and peace from God our father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great zeale your Lordship hath to the Gospel, and to the professors ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the dutie my Parentes, and my selfe did owe to your Lordshippes honorable father, of most famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, deceased (right honorable) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden mee to offer these my simple labors vnto your Lordship, as a token of my humble dutie. If the earth yeeldes increase as it were with vsury to her Tillers, much more man ought to doe the same. There is no sinne more against the nature of man then vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and therefore one of the Philosophers sayde, <hi>hee that calleth one an vnthankful person, comprehendeth in that one word all vices.</hi> And another, <hi>being asked, what thing of al others in the world died soonest, answered, a benefit</hi> or <hi>good turne:</hi> which thing in our corrupt nature, wee finde often true by experience.</p>
            <p>And although I confesse, that the forme of this my simple worke is rude, &amp; vnworthy your Lordships view, yet the matter therein contained is excellent. This short Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of S. Iude, like that pretious stone called the Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, small in quantity, but great in force, disperseth all the thicke mistes of errour and darkenesse of Antichrist. It
<pb facs="tcp:6236:3"/> lighteneth to al Christians,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.10</note> like as that starre did to the wise men, the way to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that is, as the hebrew word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, the house of breade, where Iesus Christ abideth. And then howe necessary is it for these our daies, wherein Sathan goeth about by all meanes to seduce all men, from this <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> this house of bread, to <hi>Bethauen,</hi> that is, to his house, the house of lies. Iesus Christs house is Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, in it is breade, euen the breade of life, that is, the worde of God: according to that which is written, <hi>Man liueth not by breade onely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4.4.</note>
               <hi>but by euery worde that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the mouth of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>I am the breade of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Io. 6.51.</note>
               <hi>which came downe from heauen. Hee that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this breade, and beleeueth my worde, shall liue for euer.</hi> In Gods house is this bread, and all his houshold doe feede thereof: but Sathans house is <hi>Bethauen,</hi> that is, a house of lyes:<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.11</note>
               <hi>Because they haue not receiued the loue of the truth, that they might be saued</hi> (saith the Apostle:) <hi>therefore God hath sent them strong delusions, that they shoulde beleeue lyes:</hi> As the vaine fables, varnished as it were with some shewe of deuotion and religion, drawne out of the popish Legends, which many simple Catholikes at this daie beleeue, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie proue. These two houses, this Catholike Epistle of S. Iude doth very liuely describe, as your Honour in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration thereof may perceiue. And heere no doubt,<note place="margin">Act. 8.27</note> as God sent that Noble man of Candaces Queen of Ethiopia to Ierusalem, that hee learning the truth there might by his authoritie establish it, among the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whither after hee sente also some of his Apostles to preach,<note place="margin">Psal. 77.20</note> (for in building of the Lordes house, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is, the magistrate and the minister, must ioine handes together:) So no doubt, God hath placed your Lordshippe in the North partes, that the Catholike faith, which many in those partes do loue, and this Epistle doth most plainely teach, may also there by your Lordships au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb facs="tcp:6236:3"/> be planted, and established amongst them. But when as they, which haue sore eyes will finde fault with the sunne, and seeing our daies hath too many such, which like bastarde Eagles cannot abide to beholde the true sonne of righteousnesse Iesus Christ: I most humbly craue your L. honorable patronage, against the cauilling censures and reprehensions of any such, concerning these my simple la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And thus beseeching the Lord Iesus to blesse your honour, with al temporal, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces, I most humbly take my leaue.</p>

            <head>To all true Christians, and to all them that call themselues Catholikes, at this daie in the Church of England: Grace, mercie and truth, with continuall ioy in the Holie ghost.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat notable discourse of <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (beloued in the Lorde,<note place="margin">Clem. lib. <hi>1</hi> Stromat.,</note>) is verie forcible to moue all those that be learned in Iesus Christ, to put forth their labours in print. <hi>If the godlie should not write bookes: wherefore were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters inuented? It is lawfull for the Epicure to write dishonest things: therefore much more for a Christian, such things as bee profitable. And euery man hath a care, to leaue children behinde him of his bodie: but bookes are the fruites of the minde.</hi> And againe, <hi>We call them fathers, that doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct vs:</hi> And <hi>wisdome is no niggard, she makes her selfe common to all, she is a louer of mankinde: And our Sauiour wil call all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to account, which haue receiued any talent of him. None must hide his talent in the ground.</hi> And he puts downe also the endes, whie all bookes should bee written. <hi>Not rashlie, but with deliberation: not for malice of any man, nor for vaine glory, nor for hope of rewarde, but for the profit of our brethren:</hi> Thus farre <hi>Clemens.</hi> Here wee may note, that they are reprooued, that will not set forth their workes in print; to the benefit of others. <hi>Such put a light vnder a bushell.</hi> And some such lightes, haue we at this daie; which wil not suffer their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent labours to bee published, least others should bee partakers of them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epistola.</hi> 6.</note> Whereas euen <hi>Seneca</hi> a heathen hath this notable sentence. <hi>For this ende I do desire to learne, that I may teach others. Neither any thing delightes me; be it neuer so excellent, nor so profitable, that I my selfe shoulde knowe alone. Nay, if wisdome her selfe were giuen mee vppon this condition, that I shoulde keepe her fast shut vppe, and shoulde not publish her abroad, I woulde refuse her.</hi> And this is a principall cause why the Church of Rome at this daie s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mes so glorious in the eies of many, because that in her all those that haue the best gifts, as <hi>Granatensis, Stella, Ferus</hi> and such others, whatsoeuer they haue don
<pb facs="tcp:6236:5"/> they haue published and communicated to others. But in the church of Christ there are verie manie which are endued with singular giftes and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> make their most excellent labours common to the benefit of others. The which if they would do, as the church hath now very many not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any of those: so she should haue a far greater number that woulde exceed them. But to let passe <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Seneca,</hi> and the practise of the Romanistes: much more forcible is the reason that <hi>Saint Iude</hi> here vseth in this Epistle. <hi>Putting a difference</hi> (saith hee) <hi>deale mercifully with some: and others saue with feare. pulling them as it were out of the fire.</hi> Meaning no doubt, that wee should not onely by brotherly conference, winne simple seduced Christians: but also euen by the handes of our writings, or by any other meanes what soeuer, drawe such as bee obstinate from the flame and fire of heresie. Who seeing his brother in the fire, will not pull him out? And surely so nowe the case standes in our daies. The doctrine of Antichrist flameth like a fire, and therefore it beguiles, and euen consumeth many. They will not sticke to spend all their reuenewes, so that they may continue in poperie. The great fiery zeale of the Iesuites, the eloquence, and as it were a shining light of some papists stiles, defending their causes, deceiues them. But let all true Catholiques marke heere what <hi>S. Iude</hi> teacheth, <hi>That some are to be pulled out of the fire.</hi> Though the teachers be as hot in zeale, as forcible in perswasion, as glorious in eloquence, as fire: yet if they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not the catholike doctrine contained in this epistle, embrace them not, beleeue them not. And all good christians, if this fire haue caught hold of any such; are bound with all diligence, to helpe to pull them out.</p>
            <p>And here let vs note the excellencie of this epistle: In it not only the chiefe points of Antichristian heresie; but as in a briefe mappe also, the chiefe principles of christian and catholike religion are contained. Wilt thou then be free from all danger of heresie? Wilt thou be established in the true catholik faith? Read this epistle. The labor is not great. Wouldst thou doe good workes in deede? Doe then those, which <hi>S. Iude</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. <hi>Build yee one another in your most holy faith.</hi> Here is the first and principall worke of all true christians and catholikes, To build themselues in their most holy faith: And that is by hearing, reading, and meditating of the holy scriptures. For so <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth, that this building is by the word of God: <hi>And now brethren, I commend you to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.32.</note>
               <hi>and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you farther, and to giue you an inheritance, amongst all them that are sanctified:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6236:5"/> Here wee may plainely see, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> against those rauening wolues, <hi>which shall succeede him</hi> (of whome also he speakes in the verse going before) <hi>and shall teach peruerse doctrine:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 29 30.</note> he committeth all true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and catholikes to the word of God, as to a most sure looking glasse, whereby to espie their deceits; and as to a most faithfull square &amp; rule, to build and frame their faith by: And shall we not then giue heede vnto it? And in another place he saith:<note place="margin">Col. 3. v. 16.</note>
               <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously amongst you in all wisedome, teaching and admonishing one another.</hi> As though he should say to all christians: haue not onely the word of God in your houses, but also in your hearts, that you may be able to teach and admonish one another. And this no doubt is the building <hi>S. Iude</hi> here meaneth, See what knowledge of the word of God he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in euery christian: that they should be able euen to teach and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue: which cannot be done without great knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> (saith <hi>S. Iude) pray in the holy ghost,</hi> that is, as the holy ghost shall direct and inflame your harts,<note place="margin">Theod. in Rom. 8.</note> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> expoundes this phrase: <hi>By the grace of the holy spirit we being stirred vp, we are pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in heart: being inflamed by it, we pray more cheerfully, and call vpon God with vnspeakeable sighing.</hi> Why then all christians must be perswaded that they have the holy ghost: then they must pray with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and knowledge. They must know what they pray: The holy ghost is light, and in it is no darkenesse at all. And how agrees this with the popish latine praiers which they haue vsed?</p>
            <p>Thirdly saith <hi>S. Iude, Keepe your selues in the loue of God:</hi> Be ye assured that God is your father, that hee loueth you and careth for you. Let this bee as a staffe in your handes, to passe ouer the Iordane of this world with all, with <hi>Iacob:</hi> and the ioy of your harts though sathan buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet you neuer so much, as he did <hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32. v. 10.2. Cor. 12. v. 9.</note> whom the Lord taught this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and in him all christians: <hi>My grace,</hi> my loue, <hi>is sufficient for thee.</hi> What needes thou then feare the waues of this world, nay nor all the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting and afflictions of sathan?</p>
            <p>Lastly saith <hi>S. Iude, waite for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ, to eternall life:</hi> not trusting in your owne merits, but only in his mercie: euer remembring your manifold imperfections and sinnes, and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your selues to be vnprofitable seruants. Here are the duties plainely set downe of all Gods faithfull seruants, &amp; of al true catholikes towards God. That is, <hi>continuall study and meditation of the scripture, daily praier in the holy ghost, assurance of the loue of God towardes them; and a waiting for the mercy of Iesus Christ to saluation:</hi> These are the
<pb facs="tcp:6236:6"/> workes of the true catholique Church, and of all true catholikes. Those which doe not these workes; what soeuer they doe else, God shall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for his serua ts.</p>
            <p>These points of christian religion, euery christian is daily to meditate vpon▪ these workes he must lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

King. 19 v. 8.</note> and with the comfort of this little water, no doubt with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> he shall go euen to Horeb the mountaine of God. The Lorde Iesus plant these vertues in euery Christians heart, and grant euery one grace diligently to doe these workes, and make them hunger for this bread and thirst for this water: and at last bring them to his heauenly Horeb and mountaine.</p>

            <head>¶The sum of this Epistle, and chiefe pointes of Catholique Religion contained therein and handled.</head>
            <p>FIrst it is a Catholique Epistle, because the doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is necessary for al Christians to know. The poison of the heretiques which it describeth shal not be in some one countrey, but shall spread it selfe thorow the whole world. It liuely painteth out vnto vs the church of Rome, and Antichrists kingdome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all Christians must beleeue and confesse the common saluation. That as they haue al one Sauiour: so they haue al one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saluation. That the saluation of the Apostles and of other Christians is all one. So that if they were certaine of their saluation, other christians may be certain of their saluation also. And they which teach contrary, are no Catholiques, but Heretiques.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they must maintaine the faith once giuen to the saintes. The first faith is the true faith: Sathan shall depraue and corrupt this faith. That faith which commeth in after, seeme it neuer so deuout, is the false faith: As Latine prayers, Images, purgatory, pardons, prayer to Saintes, and other such like, which I speake of in this treatise.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there shal heresies craftily creepe into the church, which shall turne the grace of God into wantonnes. And hath not poperie done so? comming into the church not all at once, but by degrees,<note place="margin">Popery tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the grace of God into wantonnes,</note> and that vnder a pretence of deuotion and holinesse. Hath it not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the grace of God into wantonnes? making religion and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, like a maske or stage play: pleasant to the flesh in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. In ringing and singing to the eares, in Images carued and gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in copes and vestments embrodered to the eies: In censing with sweet perfumes to the nose, and in their vsuall and often feasts to the bellie. Hath it not defended spirituall fornication? teaching men to trust in man, and not only in the liuing God, to commit Idolatry, and
<pb facs="tcp:6236:8"/> to worship creatures. Nay doth it not maintaine euen fleshly forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that is the stewes: and euen practise sorcery and coniuring? And is not this to turne the grace of God into wantonnes?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, these Heretiques shal denie the onely master of his house Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. They shall confesse him to be master, but not onely master. They shall ioine another with him: they shall say, hee must needes haue a vicegerent, a vicar generall vnder him: and thus they shall goe about to impaire his honor.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, they are like the Israelites, who after they were deliuered out of Egypt,<note place="margin">Papists like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnbeleeuing Israelites.</note> beleeued not the promise of God, concerning y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan: but murmured and doubted of it in the wildernes. So these, being deliuered from that great spirituall Pharaoh the deuill, by our sauiour Iesus Christ, beleeue not his promise, concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen,<note place="margin">Papists deny the Lord Iesus.</note> our true Canaan; who hath promised, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeueth in him shall haue euerlasting life: but deny the Lorde that bought them; and adde merits of their owne, to his redemption, as not perfect,<note place="margin">The church of Rome once like Lucifer was a principall mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christs Church: but now by pride is falne like him. Reue. 8.10.</note> &amp; of it selfe vnsufficient. They are like the Angels, who being placed of God in heauen in great glory, were not content with their estate, but would be like God. Euen so these, being once messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and angels in Gods church, were not content with their first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state God placed them in, but exalted themselues aboue their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Nay euen aboue all magistrates and gouernors, whom God in his word calleth gods.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, that they are like the Sodomites in sinfull life, in fleshlie lustes, in their pleasant dwellings and seates. They are opprobrious in mouth, blind and ignorant in heart, lacking the true light of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by his worde. They are bloudy teachers, like <hi>Cain,</hi> in persecuting those who reproue their sinnes, who putting those to death which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Iesus Christ, thinke they do God good seruice. They are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous teachers like <hi>Balaam:</hi> As raging flouds, running after gaine, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all their religion, doing all for money. They are rebellious like <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> who refuse the lawful magistrates, who perswade subiectes from their allegeance due vnto them: who accompt those martyrs which poison and kill them: who, to bee short, abounde in all sinne.</p>
            <p>Lastly, all true Christians must hate their ignorance, and must know Gods word, and by it must be able to edifie &amp; instruct one another, in their most holy faith; must pray, not as they doe ignorantly, but in the holy ghost, that is with vnderstanding and feruency: and must not
<pb facs="tcp:6236:8"/> doubt of their saluation, and of the loue of God towards them, as they shal go about to teach: but must keepe themselues in the loue of God, by obeying his word, neuer doubting of it. And must look for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Iesus Christ to their saluation: not trusting in their owne works, (as the Pharisie did) not hauing any workes of supererogation, more then wil serue themselues: but must confesse, when they haue done all they can, that they are vnprofitable seruauntes, that they haue done but that they ought to haue done. That all their workes whatsoeuer, and more, if they were able to doe them, are but duties, not desertes. That they are all sinners, and offenders: and must craue grace and fauour. That they are far from good seruants: &amp; can challenge no wages. This is the sum of this Epistle herein we may briefely see which is the true catholique faith: they which defende not this, are not true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, but Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6236:10"/> sathans subtleties, and ouerthroweth all his deuises. And here the verie title of this Epistle, doth euidentlie proue the same. And whereas an Epistle may be called catholique for two considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Either because it is written generallie to the whole catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique church of Christ, as was <hi>S. Peters</hi> second epistle, and this of <hi>S. Iude:</hi> or else written but to some certaine people, as <hi>S. Peters</hi> first epistle, and that of <hi>S Iames,</hi> to the dispersed brethren, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining doctrine necessarie for all christians to knowe. This epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle may seeme to be called catholique for both respects. The holie ghost did foresee, how sathan would goe about by the name of the catholique faith, to seduce many, and vnder this glorious title to beguile them. And therefore least any should be beguiled by him, the holie ghost in this epistle, doth plainly teach what is the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith, which hee shall impugne. Let not the name beguile thée, but looke west into the thing. Copper is like gold, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> reason to counsell, endued with Gods spirit, and iudge which is the man indéed. That faith, without all doubt, is the catholique faith, that is taught in this epistle. If the faith which thou accomptest catholique, be not agréeing herewith: without all doubt it is cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it is a counterfeit faith, it is not the true catholike faith. And here least anie man should pleade ignorance, or lacke of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or lacke of leasure: the holie ghost hath most plainelie, and briefely, put downe this great and waightie matter, euen to the capacitie of the simplest. Wherefore I say to euerie one that hath eares to heare, let him heare. Of the great fruit and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wee reape by hearing and reading the word of God,<note place="margin">Ferus in cap. <hi>20.</hi> Euan. secun.

If therefore thou wilt see and know Christ, heare his word.

                  <hi>As the apple comes of the seede; so blessednes comes of hearing the word of God: wherefore the Deuill takes such great care that men should not heare it, least hearing it they should obtaine this blessednes.</hi> Here marke whose ministers they are, that disswade thee from hearing the word of God. They are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6236:10"/> the diuels ministers by <hi>Philippus de Dies</hi> iudgement. As <hi>Eue</hi> accursed thee by eating the forbidden fruit, so eate thou this fruite againe if thou meane to be blessed. In the seed thereof is effectual blessednesse conteined.

                  <hi>For as among other differences which are betwixt birdes and beastes, this is one, That if in the night a light or torch bee placed, before the eyes of birdes, they will all forthwith flie vnto it: but contrariwise, if a light be set before beastes, they flie from it, and hide their countenances, because they cannot abide the brightnes of the torch. So likewise betwixt the predestinate and those whome God hath onely foreknowne, this difference is found. For the word of God is a light shining in the middle of the night, of this world. As kingly <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, Thy worde is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my pathes. And the birdes, that is the predestinate: seeing this light, which the preachers set before their eyes, runne after it: with their taste, affection and deuotion. But sinners like vnto beastes, not being able to endure this light, by and by turne their backes and flie from it.</hi> Let euerie christian heere beware, how he turne awaie his eares from hearing Gods worde: séeing by a papistes owne iudgement, it is a manifest signe, of a reprobate. And let euerie one iudge what she was, that kept this light from the eies of our forefathers. They could not bee suffered to see it, to looke vpon it: surelie she was not the spouse of Christ, but the sinagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who is a prince of darkenes, and himselfe cannot abide this light. Let all true christians delight in this light: as in the light of the sunne. Let euerie christian marke, that same spirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which (as it were in a little bundle) the holie ghost prescribeth to euery christian soldiour. <hi>There was a battell in heauen,</hi>

                  <hi>and the Dragon was ouercome, and the Diuel and his angels are now thrown down from heauen, by the power of Iesus Christ, that great <hi>Michael,</hi> who before accused our brethren in heauē before the maiesty of God, euen night and day.</hi> As there we may plainely read verse <hi>10.</hi> and as we may see <hi>Iob 1.</hi> and <hi>1. King. 22. verse 21.

Where by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6236:11"/> first is meant, that of al their deadly wounds and sinnes, which is this battell they should receiue, they were to be cured by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the death and passion of Iesus Christ. And this place, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue a resemblance,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.22.</note> with that of <hi>Exodus.

               <p>Secondlie, the weapon to wounde this their enimie, is the worde of their testimonie. That is the word of God, whereof they are witnesses, of the trueth, sufficiencie, and certaintie of euerie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They which will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sathan, must loue the worde of God, must knowe it, nay must bee witnesses or martyrs, euen venturing their liues for it if occasion serue. For that the word (witnesse) signifieth. The word of God, must bee their profession, their testimonie; that it is the rule of lyfe, the touchstone of trueth, the ground worke of fayth, and the onelie roote of true religion. A witnesse must not onelie saie the truth, but sweare it, yea if néede be, dye for it. Such great zeale must all good christians haue to Gods worde. And such har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, such weapons, all those, that mind to ouercome sathan, must haue. This is plaine, this cannot be denyed. Therefore to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses or martyrs principally for the church, or for the prerogatiue thereof, (for which manie heeretofore and now, do venter their liues) is not to be true witnesses or martyrs. They must ouercome sathan by the blood of the lambe, and by the worde of their testy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, that will bee indeede true victors and conquerers of him.

                  <hi>and brother of Iames]</hi> This is a rare saluation, as a learned man noteth; and vnlike the other saluations of the Apostles: but full of doctrine, full of comforte. This Epistle is but a shorte Epistle: but by it, as by a little touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, gold from copper: as by a small fanne, wheate from chaffe: that is true Christians and Catholikes, from false, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite, are easilie to be discerned. Here, as in a litle map, the whole sum of Christian religion, is set down: who will not then highlie esteeme it; wherein so excellent thinges, so plainely &amp; briefely are cōteined? The principal duty of seruaunts in the holy scriptures, is taught vs in two wordes, that is, in obedience, and feare.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.5.</note>
                  <hi>You seruaunts (saieth <hi>S.</hi> Paul) obey your masters.</hi> Wherein this worde (obey) in the gréeke, importeth an obedience of the eare, specially: that is, that all seruantes shoulde obey their masters worde and commaundement: be it neuer so harde, séeme it neuer so strange, although it be against reason, in their owne iudgements.<note place="margin">Gen. 12.1.</note> So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> obeyed God, like a good seruante, going out of the lande of <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> being <hi>70.</hi> yeares old.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.10.</note> So he would haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his sonne <hi>Isacke.</hi> in whome, God had promised him, all the nations of the worlde should be blessed, and whom hee loued most dearelie. So <hi>Noah</hi> obeyed the commaundements of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.22</note> in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his monie, in making an Arke: when as all the mightie, and wise men of that world, laughed him to scorne, and accounted him as a foole for his labour: Being alone, and none to take his parte or to assist him, but Gods worde onelie, which no doubt was a notable comforte vnto him. The verie carpenters, that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his monie, and framed the arke, were drowned, they beléeued not this worde and commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>Wée haue examples againe in the scripture of euill ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. <hi>Saul</hi> a King, being commanded to slay <hi>Amalecke,</hi> thought,<note place="margin">Sa. 15.9.</note> by his authoritie, he might pardon the king, and saue the fatlings: and hee had some good intente in this his doing, to offer sacrifice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6236:12"/> thereof to God. But for this his disobedience, to Gods word and commandement, though a king, hee was reiected. The Israelites are reproued by all the prophets, for their costlie sacrifices, and stately buildings, which they called their high places, which besides Gods commandement they ordained. And therefore by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 1.12</note> God condemneth all this their external, hypocriticall, and voluntary religion: saying, <hi>who required this at your handes, to trample in my courts?</hi> That is, to bee present with your bodies, but to haue your hearts far off. <hi>Offer you no more the lying or false offering or gift: your frankinsence or perfume are abhomination to me.</hi>

So that the principall duty of Gods seruantes, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his word, as appeareth by these examples.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, to feare to offende him. Both these are also by our sauiour in the gospell, linked together in two wordes: <hi>who is a faithfull and wise seruant.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 12.42. Rom. 10.17 Pro. 1.7</note> Faithfulnes, is obedience to his word, to do all things he commandeth. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the word of God:</hi> And <hi>the first point of wisedome is to feare the Lord.</hi> So that seruants must bee faithfull in doing their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters will, and wise in fearing to offend him. So the Lorde by the prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> requireth this of his seruants. <hi>If I be a master, where is my feare?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 1.6</note> In times past there was great feare in the worlde, whereof many will talke at this daie; howe loath men were to break their penāces laid on them: but this was the feare of man.

For the feare of God consisteth chiefelie in kéeping his commandements.<note place="margin">Matth. 25</note> So the Iewes were afraide to eate with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washen hands, to sweare by the golde of the temple, and such like precepts they obserued: but this was no feare of God.

The forgetfulnes hereof, is the cause of all the hard dealings, that now is in the world. We forget that we deale with our brethren. This consideration, woulde cease manie quarrels: which are so

               <p>And here is to be marked one other excellent point of doctrine, that the works of the Trinity are common together, &amp; the works of one of them are attributed to the other. As we are said here to be sanctified of God the father:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2</note> so we are saide to be sanctified by Iesus Christ. And as Iesus Christ is commonlie called our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: so God is called our sauiour. Thereby also to teach vs,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. v 1.</note> that our workes ought to be common, wee should bee all as brethren, no man should labour alone. When as God had appointed <hi>Iudah</hi> after the death of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> to go vp before the children of Israell, to be their captain, &amp; to fight against the Canaanites: <hi>Iudah</hi> though he were appointed alone, said to <hi>Simeon</hi> his brother,<note place="margin">Iudg. 1.3</note>
                  <hi>Come and go vp with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Cananites. And I likewise will go vp with thee into thy lot: and so <hi>Simeon</hi> went with him. So our Sauiour sent his disciples two and two togither before him into euery city and place whither he should come!.</hi> So <hi>S. Paul</hi> in most of his Epistles, ioineth some of the brethren with him, as <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and <hi>Siluanus:</hi> hee seldome writeth any Epistle alone.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.1</note> Teaching all christians, and especiallie the ministers of God, this holie fellowship, this communicating of their labours one with another, this brotherlie helpe in the Lordes worke, this ioyning of handes togither. God himselfe hath done so: all the saintes of God haue done so: and why should not we do so? It would make our labours light, and our workes easie, as the prouerbe is: By many handes a great worke is made light and easie. And if the saints of God, being mightie in respect of vs, and strong in the inward man, and abounding in the giftes of the holie ghost, haue done this: how much more ought we, who are weake in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of them, vpon whom the end of the worlde is come, to vse this mutuall aid &amp; societie, in our labors. This is that great &amp; general &amp; roial law of Christ. <hi>One should beare anothers burthē.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.2</note> This is not only wisedom, but it is a cōmandement. And how is this heauēly wisdome forgotten? how is this roial law neglected? Our worldly wisedome hath drowned it, our selfe loue hath ouerflowed it, our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6236:14"/> vaine glorie hath surprised it: we thinke skorne to impart our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to others, to aske helpe of anie, or to giue our helping hand to any. This roiall law of Christ is broken. Euerie man nowe is for himselfe. There is no communicating of helpe, of workes, of labours, of riches: neither in the Church, nor in the common wealth. In the Lordes haruest wee labour alone: and in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest of our fieldes, we labour for our selues. For our neighbour, may be behind with his corne, may lacke helpe: and no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most will care for him. If he lacke seed, he shall pay déerelie for it. God here, by his owne example, teacheth vs another lesson.</p>

But therefore perchance wee are accompted lesse lawfull brethren, because no tragedie exclameth of our brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, or because in our goods and riches we are brethren: which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them breaketh their brotherhood.

These were the Israelites merites, and such were all ours: and this was Gods great mercie.

But if this be true, what case are they in then, which haue them not in their heartes at all, neither as in a narrow, nor in a large roome? This largenes of the heart is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And it is to be feared, where this largenesse is not, God is not. God is most mightie, most free, most large, he cannot abide to bee pinched. And therefore they which will haue God dwell in their hearts, must thus enlarge them. Our princes will not dwel in narrow cottages, but in large palaces: no more will God, the king of kinges.

And it bringeth vs into a league, into a societie, and loue, euen with God himselfe.

This assurance, of obtaining the thinges we aske, this doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our flesh, which is to bee ouercomed by faith: argueth a knowledge of these thinges we aske.

               <p>Secondlie, it is to be feared, that the lacke of this faith, causeth that manie, that know what they praie, do not obtaine their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They pray doubtfullie, they prayeareleslie, they pray vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: So that they say ouer their praiers, they make no accompt, how their hearts be affected. But such, though they praie neuer so often, nor so long, shall obtaine nothing at Gods handes.

This doubting is against the nature of faith, it is against our common saluation, it is against the doctrine of the Apostles. Wherefore of all thinges that we are assured of, let vs bee of this one thing most assured in our hearts, without doubtfulnesse: that wee shall be saued, euen as the Apostles were.

                  <hi>We know him, nay rather we are knowne of him.</hi> Our knowledge is nothing to his knowledge; no more is our being in the world, to his being in the world, though we iudge him manie times absent. As we are héere liuing: so is hee héere, louing vs: as we in dangers, so he defending: as we wandering, so he gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: as we often stumbling, so he (of his great mercie) holding vs vp.

               <p>But this certaintie of saluation, is confirmed to all christians by another most excellent testimonie:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.5</note>
                  <hi>God</hi> (saieth <hi>S.

And why? what was his comfort do you think? Surelie hee himselfe declares to all Christians, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues hauing the like, should bee alwaies of good comfort, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer should befal them: <hi>God</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath giuen vs the earnest of his spirit, and therefore wee are of good courage alwaies.</hi> Euen as one making a bargaine, if hee haue the earnest, hee is sure of the bargaine: so God hauing promised vs heauen, giueth to all his the earnest thereof, in this life, that they might be assured of it. If the earnest giuen and taken, confirme the bargaine and couenant of a mortall man: much more the earnest of the immortall and immutable God, confirmeth his couenant of saluation made to all his. And this earnest <hi>S.

I answere, examine thine owne heart: If thou haue good thoughts, good cogitations, faith in Iesus Christ, loue to his worde, desire to pray, and such like good workes: be sure thou hast the earnest in thee.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.5 Gen. 6.5 Ezech. 36.26</note>
                  <hi>For of our selues we are not able to think a good thought. The deuises of man are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked euen from his birth. Mans heart is a heart of stone, wherein it is

There are two great cities in this worlde, the one of God, and the other of the diuell; and all men whatsoeuer are enfranchised, in the one, or in the other. And their names declare their natures; the one is called Babilon, that is confusion, trouble, vncertaintie, doubtfulnesse: the other Ierusalem, that is the vision of peace, quietnes, securitie, safetie, happinesse.

                  <note place="margin">Esay. 12.1.</note>The prophet <hi>Esay</hi> seemes as it were in a briefe map to set forth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6236:25"/> the true church of Christ: and first hee putteth downe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar workes of euerie Christian, and then the generall workes of the whole Church. <hi>And in that day of the kingdome of Christ, thou shalte say,</hi> euerie Christian must saie, <hi>I will confesse thee O Lorde, thou hast beene angry with mee: but thou hast comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me.</hi> He must saie he is an vnprofitable seruant, when he hath done what he is able. To the Pharisies that said they did see, their sinne remained. The first marke of Christs church is to be poore in spirit, that euerie one confesseth himselfe to be shal lost sheepe, that Iesus Christ came downe from heauen, to seeke for: and to be as thankefull, as though he had died for him alone. And truely he must saie; <hi>behold the Lord is my saluation: I wil trust in him, and I wil not feare.</hi> He must accompt his saluation a wonderful work, such a one as neuer was heard of: the which, that word <hi>(behold)</hi> seemes to infer. That <hi>Dauid</hi> shoulde kill <hi>Goliah, Sampson</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Philistines, that <hi>Alexander</hi> should conquer the whole worlde, that the thrée children should walke through the midst of the fierie furnace: All these wonders were nothing to the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to the conquest of the diuell, the world and hell, by our sauiour, by deliuering vs from the lions mouthes, by enduring the fierie furnace of Gods wrath, and the paines of hell which we should haue suffered. So that wee may iustlie saie, <hi>beholde the Lord is my Sauiour, I will trust in him, and I wil not feare.</hi> He must accompt especiallie Iesus Christ to be his, amongst his other pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions whatsoeuer. He must liue by his owne faith, and not by the faith of the church. And he must accompt his saluation so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: that he must not feare. And the reason followeth, <hi>because God is his strength daily:</hi> he doth not onlie saue in the beginning; but dailie strengthens: according to that saying of <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.6 Iohn. 13 1 Psal. 48.14 Rom. 8.15</note>

Paul</hi> also yéeldeth his consent to this doctrine; <hi>For yee haue not receiued the spirit of bondage to feare againe: but ye haue receiued the spirit of adoption, whereby we crie <hi>Abba,</hi> father.</hi> And to make the matter more sure, he repeateth the same doctrine:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.7</note>
                  <hi>For God hath not giuen to vs the spirit of feare, but of power, and of loue, and of a sound mind.</hi> Where wee may note, that the first fruit of the spirit of God, is this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our saluation, which is heere expressed by crying <hi>Abba,</hi>

                  <hi>Yea the Lord God is my song.)</hi> We do sing in great and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ioy: as that saying teacheth, <hi>how can we sing the Lordes song in a strange lande?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 137. v. 4.</note> when anie is in sorrow or griefe, hee will haue no lyst to sing: but our saluation is so sure, that we euen sing for ioy thereof. And that which followeth in the prophet euidentlie prooueth the same: <hi>The Lorde is my song, and hee is become my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> This is as it were the burthen, or ground of the song, this is often repeated, againe, and againe; <hi>The Lorde is my saluation.</hi> So that here may séeme to be the particular works of euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, to confesse his sinnes, to acknowledge Iesus Christ his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, not to feare or doubt: but euen to sing for ioy and certainty of his saluation. The workes of the church in generall, likewise followe:<note place="margin">Es. 12.3.</note>
                  <hi>And they shall drawe water out of the welles of saluation with ioie.</hi> The welles of saluation, of comfort; are the scriptures, as <hi>S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  </hi> sayth:<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note>
                  <hi>The scriptures are written for our learning, that through patience and comfort of the holie scriptures,</hi>

                  <hi>wee might haue hope: And Dauid sayth, With thee is the well of lyfe, and in thy light shall wee see light:</hi>

                  <hi>And it is called the worde of lyfe,</hi> which is all one, with the welles of saluation. So that then, all men must knowe and meditate vpon the scriptures in that daie of Iesus Christ (as <hi>Dauid</hi> also witnesseth) if they will be blessed. This is the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worke of all Christians.<note place="margin">Gen. 26.18.</note>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isack</hi> historicallie dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged wels, and the Philistines stopped them vp.

                  <hi>The gracious God</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid) hath so done his maruellous workes, that they ought to bee had in remembrance.</hi>

And this is to shewe the Lordes death till he come.</p>
               <p>And lastlie to put all men in remembrance, of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifience of this name Iesus Christ. It should séeme, the prophet did foresée that in spirit, which we sée verified indéede: howe the magnifience and greatnes of this name, should be forgotten; and how other names should be had in estimation. And therefore he giueth all true Christians a lesson: that they onelie call vpon God in his name, and that they cause the magnifience of his name to be had in remembrance. These workes the carnall man accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth nothing: to reade or meditate vppon the scriptures, to praise God daylie, for what good thing soeuer he receiueth, to be talking daylie of Gods wonderfull workes, hee doth continuallie and hath done: (for men loue to be talking of great &amp; strang works:) and when they lacke anie thing (as they are daylie standing in néede of manie thinges euen the richest of them all) to begge of God, in the name of Iesus Christ: to magnifie and extoll this name onelie, to haue it euer in their mouthes, to do all thinges in the name of Iesus Christ. But these passe all their pilgrimages, gylding of Images, building of guyldes or chantries, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore men so highlie estéemed.</p>

But as Christ had witnesse from heauen and on earth, that onelie he was the true and onelie sauiour of the worlde: so euery Christian hath the same testimonies, that he is the sonne of God.

And in the morning, when he should go forward with his officers, he made more a doe then he was wont, and he did all things so, that if it were possible, very few or none might be in danger: yet notwithstanding, hee sawe the people moe in number then they were wont, to go to the place, and to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and to make haste, as though they were afraide least any man should be lacking to death. In the meane time, he sawe a woman to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6236:27"/> to run out of her house so hastily and speedily, that she did not so much as shut her doore, &amp; also she her selfe was half ready &amp; halfe vnready. And she drew her little child with her, and she made such haste, that she brake thorow the midst of the ranke of his officers. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure no longer, lay hands on the woman</hi> (saith he,) <hi>and bring her to me, and being brought, hee saieth: O vnhappy woman! whither doest thou make such haste? To the field</hi> (saith she) <hi>where the people of the Catholiques do meete. And hast thou not heard (saieth he) that the Lieutenant goeth thither, that he may kill all that he shall finde? I haue heard (saith shee:) and therefore I make haste, that <hi>I</hi> may bee found there. And whither, saith hee, drawest thou this little one? That it also, saith she, may deserue martyrdome. The which things when the pitifull man had heard, he commanded the officers to returne, and his chariot to be caried to the Emperors pallace. And entering in, he saith, ô Emperour, if thou commandest me to die; <hi>I</hi> am readie: but the worke which thou commandest me, I cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill. And when as he had shewed him all thinges of the woman, hee staied the furie of the Emperour.</hi> No doubt this was a common lesson in those daies, that all they that beléeued in Iesus Christ, shoulde surelie bee saued, which this simple woman had learned: No doubt she was surelie perswaded she should bee saued, or else shee would neuer haue made such haste to death. I reade also of <hi>Cyprian</hi> bishop of Carthage,<note place="margin">Anton. hist. part. <hi>1.</hi> Tit. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>8</hi>
                  </note> whose famous works are at this day extant in the church of God, that for the christian religion beeing first banished of the Emperors <hi>Galienus</hi> and <hi>Valerianus;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde called backe againe, and condemned to death for the same, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> when he heard the sentence of his condemnation: <hi>he gaue God thankes, and shewed no token of sadnes. And after hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his friendes, to giue his executioner fiue and twenty ryals for his paines: because he should receiue a benefit, and not any harme or destruction at his handes.</hi>

Neither was this faith and assurance of saluation in these bishops and learned men, but generally in all christians.</p>

                  <hi>In the raigne of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> a certaine woman of Alexandria, being instructed in the faith of Christ by one called <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> began to detest her husbands ryot &amp; adulteries: when he would not amend, after many admonitions, she preferred a bill of diuorcement, and was diuorced from him.

So wee are content with the bountifulnes of our God (concerning worldly affaires) and carelesse, through that hope of happines to come, in our martyrdomes: and through the faith of the presence of his maiestie, wee are encouraged in our tormentes; so we doe rise againe blessed, and wee liue nowe, through the hope of that which is for to come.</hi> Heere wee may see what made so many martyrs in those daies, the certaine hope of

                  <hi>And God opened the doore of faith to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> that is, of religion. <hi>And Paul preached the faith which hee had persecuted,</hi> that is, the religion. Here then is the sum and dryft of this Epistle, here is the grounde and foundation of true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion; <hi>to striue for to maintaine with all our force and might, the faith, the religion, once giuen to the saintes:</hi> Not that faith which should be giuen hereafter, but that which was giuen alreadie: not that faith which shoulde be made by degrees, in processe of time, by the decrees of Popes and councelles; but that which was once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the saintes. God gaue his lawe to the Iewes in the olde Testament, by the hand of his seruant <hi>Moses:</hi> so in the gospell he established his new Testament and league, by his sonne Iesus Christ, and his Apostles. <hi>Moses</hi> but a seruant ouer Gods house had this preheminence, much more the sonne of God, the wisdom of God the father. And of the perfection of the gospell of Iesus Christ, <hi>S. Paul</hi> writes no lesse, then <hi>Moses</hi> wrote of the perfection of his lawe, (that nothing was to be added to it,) but farre more; <hi>If we our selues (saith he) or an Angell from heauen,</hi>

                  <hi>preach vnto you besides that we haue preached vnto you,</hi> (adding to it, altering in it anie thing, or departing eyther to the right hand, or to the left hand from it) <hi>Let him be accursed.</hi> Neither doth he saie this once, but he saieth it againe: no doubt mooued by Gods spirite, because men would forget this lesson, and Sathan should go about to take this séede out of their heartes especially, as we haue seene by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: And therefore the Apostle, as a wise husband-man, sowes this séede twise. So that then, the first faith which was giuen ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutelie to the saintes, by Iesus Christ and his Apostles, is the true Catholique fayth. This is <hi>S. Iudes</hi> resolution, concerning this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6236:29"/> great question which troubleth so many at this day. And they which are trulie wise, will agrée with him; and will make this an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ground, &amp; most certaine rule, to measure true catholique religion by. And this is not onlie his priuate iudgement, but it is the definitiue sentence of al the Apostles, &amp; of our blessed saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himselfe: Who giuing his Apostles, and in them all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and pastors,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. v. 19.20.</note> authoritie to preach: <hi>All power (saieth he) is giuen me in heauen and earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in the name of the father, of the son and of the holie ghost: Teaching them to keepe whatsoeuer I haue commaunded you: And beholde, I am with you alwaies, euen to the worldes end.</hi> Here is that great and large commission and authority, of preaching, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ministerie of him, who hath all power in heauen and earth. I would to God our mightie men of the world, woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, whose embassadors and seruants ministers are; and then, they would not vse them as they do. They would then think nothing too deare for them. Secondlie, here is, what they ought to preach and teach, whatsoeuer Iesus Christ hath commanded them. His doctrine, his commandements, are sufficient. They maie not go beyonde their commission.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Epist.</hi> Iohan. v. 9.</note> And <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saieth, <hi>Whosoeuer trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth,</hi> or goeth beyond, <hi>and abydeth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.</hi> We maie not go beyonde, or go further, then that which Iesus Christ hath taught; herein we must rest, continue and abyde: though he which teach it, be neuer so ancient, though he be a father, though he be neuer so holie, though he were an Angel, though the doctrine séeme neuer so deuoute, plausible and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He that continues and abydes, and settles his conscience in the doctrine of Christ: he hath both the father and the sonne. And what can be desired more? And lastlie, to them that kéepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues within the boundes of this their commission, Iesus Christ promiseth, that he will bee with them, euen vnto the ende of the world. They néed to feare, neither Pope, Prince or Potentate: they haue one mightier then all these, that taketh their partes. <hi>S. Paul</hi> also in his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> testifieth the same. <hi>I thanke my God (saieth he) alwaies in your behalfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 1. v. 4.</note>
                  <hi>for the grace of God which is giuen you in Iesus Christ, that in all thinges you are rich in him, in all speech and in all knowledge, as the witnesse of Iesus Christ was surelie confirmed among you: so that you wanted no gift, looking for the reuelation of our Lorde Iesus Christ.</hi> By this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6236:29"/> place it appeares, that the Corinthians had receiued this grace from God (for the which the Apostle giueth God thankes, as for a most excellent gift) that they were rich in all knowledge, and now wanted nothing, concerning their saluation, but euen now were readie and prepared for the glorious appearance of Iesus Christ to iudgment. So that their faith was perfect, there was nothing as necessary to be added vnto it: they were sufficientlie prepared and armed against the daie of iudgement. And who will desire any more? all péeces and patches then, concerning faith and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which came into the church after, were néedelesse and in vaine.<note place="margin">Cap. 20.26</note> And in the Actes <hi>S. Paul</hi> taking his leaue of the Elders and pastors of the church of Ephesus: <hi>I take you to record this day,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I am innocent from the bloud of you all. For I haue not kept backe any thing, but declared vnto you all the counsell of God.</hi> Who will not confesse then, that the faith once giuen to the saints was perfect: who seeth not, that what pointes of faith or of doctrin concerning saluation came in after, were not the counsel of God, but deuises of man?<note place="margin">Psal. 3.8.</note> And therefore in this matter vtterlie to bee reiected. <hi>For saluation</hi> (as it is in the Psalme) <hi>belongeth only to the Lord,</hi> to his wisedome, mercie, counsell and direction: <hi>And his blessing is vpon his people;</hi> all the good thinges his church enioieth, procéed also from him. The same thing also saint <hi>Peter</hi> witnesseth: <hi>By <hi>Siluanus</hi> a faithfull brother,</hi> saith he, <hi>as I suppose,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.12.</note>
                  <hi>haue I written brieflie, exhorting and testifying, howe that this is the true grace of God wherein you stande:</hi> calling with <hi>S. Paul</hi> the true faith, the true way of saluation; the grace of God. So that then <hi>S. Peter</hi> himselfe witnesseth to all christians in the worlde, that that was the true grace of God, that that was the true way of saluation, in which they stood then; the which they had receiued then, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them with <hi>S. Iude</hi> to continue and to maintaine the same. And if that any other glad tidings, or glad newes were brought them, or any other grace of God, that it was not the true grace of God, but a false and counterfeit. For there is but one faith,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.5</note> and those giftes which come from God are perfect. They are like himselfe: as <hi>S. Iames</hi> also witnesseth.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> And least any man shoulde say, that this grace of God is vncertaine, and that hee knoweth not where to find this faith once giuen to the saintes: <hi>S. Iames</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs where this faith is to be found, that is in the worde of God: <hi>Receiue the word with all meekenes which is grafted in you, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6236:30"/> is able to saue your soules.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15</note> And the same <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Timothie: Continue in these thinges that thou hast learned and art perswaded thereof, knowing of whome thou hast learned them, and that thou hast knowne the holy scriptures of a childe, which are able to make thee wise vnto saluation, through the faith which is in Iesus Christ. Timothie</hi> knew the scriptures euen from his childhoode: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all true christians and catholiques, not bee afraide to teach them their children, and to make them reade them also. <hi>Timothie</hi> a child knewe them: therefore it is a shame for men not to knowe them. The scriptures are able to make vs wise to saluation: and then are they not perfect? is not this plaine? who will desire anie more? And this saluation is in them, by teaching this faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, this faith once giuen to the saintes. So that then, this faith once giuen to the saintes, is to be gathered out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they teach it, fullie, plainly and absolutely.</p>
               <p>Neither is this the Apostles sentence, but also the iudgment of many learned men since. And of this place of <hi>S. Iude, Nicolaus de Lira</hi> writeth thus: <hi>In this epistle <hi>S. Iude</hi> instructs al christiās ingeneral &amp; not certain particular persōs, as did <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his 2. former Epistles, (I haue need to write to you.) For heretickes springing vp: as it shal be put down after,</hi> (beseeching you to fight valiantlie, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faith once giuen to the saints) <hi>as though he should say, this is the cōbat of faith, that is, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faith giuen to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> saints, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is, to the Apostles of Christ: once, that is perfectly, when he opened their vnderstāding, that they should vnderstand the scriptures. It is also said once, for the vnity thereof, and of the Authour thereof: There is one God, one faith, one baptisme. And here is put down the cause of this combate or warre, (for there are craftily and slilie crept in) that is, (saith he) vnder a shew of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they haue come in (certaine vngodly men) that is heretiques. For godlines is sometime taken for the worship of God: but heretiques vnder the pretence of religion and Gods worde haue brought in the contrary, &amp; therfore they are called vngodly.</hi> So that then by <hi>Lirah</hi> his iudgement, this epistle concernes all men. The faith once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> saintes, was giuen by Christ to his Apostles, when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their vnderstādings, that they might vnderstand the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And therefore as should seeme, this faith was to bee taken out of the scriptures. And that heretiques, vnder a shew of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God, besides the scriptures, should corrupt the faith, and bring into the church a contrarie faith. And that this faith was giuen once, that is, perfectly. And the <hi>ordinary glosse,</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6236:30"/> in the person of <hi>S. Iude,</hi> expoundes this place thus: <hi>I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching you not to superadde any other faith, to your faith; but for the holy faith once giuen vnto you, and to all the saintes by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, to fight earnestly euen vnto death: that for it if neede bee, you should die. And therfore I haue written vnto you, that I might know the state of your faith, and that I might shewe you my carefulnesse of you, and so you might be confirmed in the faith.</hi> So that <hi>Lirah</hi> sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that that is the true faith which Christ himselfe gaue to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, when hee opened their vnderstandings, that they might vnderstand the scriptures: And the glosse saith, that that is the true faith which the Apostles gaue to the saintes, for the which we must striue, euen to death: and therefore by their iudgementes wee are not to make any accompt of that faith, which shall come in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That is the Antichristian and false faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferus</hi> also vpon <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Epistle writes thus, vpon these words,<note place="margin">In primam epist. <hi>10.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>(that you haue hearde from the beginning: let it abide in you.) Hee giues (saith he) faithfull counsell what wee must doe, when false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Antichrist shall breake into the church: For otherwise hee had made mention in vaine, that such should come into the church, vnlesse he had forewarned vs also, what wee should doe. His counsell is, that we should abide in that, wee haue hearde from the beginning. Excellent counsel; for as soone as we begin to doubt of that we haue beene taught from the beginning, wee giue entrance to errors. And therefore Christ inculcates these wordes to his disciples: Abide in me, and I in you: Take heede no man beguile you, saying here is Christ, or there is Christ, beleeue them not. And <hi>S. Paul,</hi> But continue thou, in those things thou hast learned, knowing of whome thou hast lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them.</hi> And againe: <hi>Be not caried away, with diuers and strange doctrines.</hi> And againe: <hi>Bee not mooued with euery winde of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after he writes thus: <hi>yee haue beene taught not only what things concerne faith, but also what concerne godlines and holinesse of life. Here, saith hee, thou maiest marke, howe much christian doctrine, and the worde of God, is to bee esteemed of vs. Hereby wee are brought to great honor, and wee reape great profit. Can there bee any honour greater, then to abide in the father and the sonne? and hee gets this honour that continues in the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles.</hi> And after, vpon the same chapter he writes thus: <hi>whatsoeuer is necessary to saluation, that already the spirit hath made manifest to the church by the word of the gospell, and by his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6236:31"/> inspiration.</hi> And a little after, <hi>The Anabaptists separate the holy ghost from the scriptures, and from the externall preaching of the worde; when as this is the true meane, by the which the holy ghost doth teach vs, that is to say, the scripture, and the outward preaching of the worde. Therefore no man ought to separate the holy Ghost from the scripture, &amp;c. The holy ghost taught the olde prophets for most part by secret inspirations, or visions offered to their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without the outwarde preaching. It taught the Apostles, the wordes of Christ, by suggesting vnto them, and by bringing that into their remembrances, which they had hearde of Christ: It teacheth vs now, by the meanes of the holy scriptures and word of God. And he that despiseth these meanes, hee lookes for in vaine, anie newe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde instruction of the holie ghost: yea therefore the holie scripture is giuen to vs as a certain rule of Christian doctrine, least our owne spirit should seduce vs. And if there were no rule of doctrine put down, who seeth not what a confusion and chaos there would bee? For, if hauing the holie scripture as a most certain rule set before our eyes, they do teach such diuers doctrines: what would come to passe, if the scriptures were taken awaie?</hi> So that by <hi>Ferus</hi> his iudgement, the holie scriptures are the most certaine rule, to measure and square all doctrines by; they are the onely meanes, by which the holy spirit nowe teacheth the church, and that the spirite ought not to bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from them: And that in them, is the faith co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="6 letters">

                  <hi>What disputations or writings of any of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, what lawes of any city, are to be compared by any meanes to those two precepts; of which, Christ saieth, all the lawe and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do depende: Thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thy selfe. Here are phisicks</hi> (as they terme them) <hi>because all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall causes are in God, the creator. Here are Ethickes, because a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans lyfe, is by no other meanes framed, then when those things are loued which are to be loued, that is God and our neighbour: here is logicke, because the truth and light of the soule of man, is nothing else, but God himselfe. Here is the happie estate of the common wealth: For a happie citie is not builded or preserued, but by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and bonde of fayth, and concorde; when as the common good thing is loued, which both most excellent and truest is God himselfe; and in him, when men do sincerelie one loue another; when as for his sake they loue one another: when as they cannot keepe secrete, for what cause they loue one another. The manner of writing, whereby the scripture is framed, how easie is it for all men, although verie fewe can attaine to the perfection of it. Those plaine thinges which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth, as a familiar friende, without all deceit, it speaketh to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie or heart, of the learned or vnlearned: And those things which she hydeth in a mysterie, she extolles them not with a loftie style, that a slowe and vnlearned mynde, dare not approach vnto them, (as a poore man dare not come to a rich) but with a lowlie speech, shee
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6236:32"/> inuites all men vnto her; whome shee will not onelie feede, with her manifest; but also exercise with her secret truth: And yet, hauing the same in a readinesse and easie, which she hath shut vppe in secret. But least they being too manifest, should be lothed, they are againe hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; that they maie be sought for, and being sought after, they are as it were renewed: and being renewed, they are most surely disgested. By them</hi> (meaning the scriptures) <hi>both all wicked soules are correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and simple are increased, and great are delighted. That soule is enemy onely to this doctrine, who erring, either knoweth not that it is most wholesome, or else being sicke, hateth her phisicke.</hi> What could bee more euidentlie spoken of the sufficiencie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Here is logicke, ethicke, and naturall philosophie; here is the happie estate of all common wealthes; here is the blessednes of all soules, rightnesse for the crooked, strength for the weake, delight of the perfect. This noble Ladie, with her most lowlie voice, inuiteth all men to her: no man néede bee afraide to come, as the poore are to the rich: her doctrine passeth not mans reach; she hath the same things manifest to feed withall, which she hath hid to exercise withall.</p>

                  <hi>Cyril</hi> also of the sufficiencie of the scriptures thus writeth most manifestlie: <hi>Therefore not all thinges, which the Lorde hath done are written: but what thinges they which wrote, thought to suffice, both to manners and to doctrine; that wee shining with a right faith, with workes and vertue, might come to the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And here by the way,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> orthodox. explicat.</note> let vs marke how <hi>Andradius</hi> goeth about to obscure this most euident place of <hi>Cyrill: If S.

Not all thinges which the Lord hath done are written (saieth hee) but such as those which writ thought to suffice, to maners and doctrine; he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all holie writers within this compasse, not <hi>S.

                  <hi>Cyril</hi> writes thus againe of the sufficiencie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures; <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>as far as my smal capacity can attaine do thinke, that in these two daies, the two Testamentes may bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, wherein euery worde, that concernes God, may be discussed, (for that is a sacrifice) and out of them the knowledge of all thinges is to bee receiued. If any thing remaine, which the holy scripture doth not determine, no other thirde scripture ought to bee receiued, that might be in authority amongst vs to get knowledge, which he called here the third day: but let vs commit that which remaines to the fire: that is, let vs reserue it to God. For in this life God would, not haue vs know all thinges, especially when as the Apostle saith, <hi>Because wee nowe knowe in part, &amp;c.</hi> This therefore is the fire to the which wee must reserue all those thinges that remaine, and not through rash presumption, take to vs knowledge of all thinges, that the Apostle may iustly say to vs: not knowing what they say, nor what they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Therefore, least peraduenture our sacrifice should not bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and that same knowledge, which wee couet to haue out of the scriptures, be turned into sinne: let vs keepe those measures which the spirituall law, by her law maker, shewes to vs.</hi> See how plainly <hi>Cyrill</hi> concludes, all knowledge necessary for vs in this life, in the scriptures. And in searching out of them, he would not haue vs also to go too far, but to kéepe those limits our law giuer hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: and that in this life, it is no shame to confesse our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of many things: and that no third scripture whatsoeuer is to be admitted, to supplie the wants of this scripture, to teach that which it teacheth not.

                  <hi>Philippus de Dies</hi> also writes thus of the excellencie and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the scriptures: <hi>It was,</hi> saith he, <hi>a singular benefit of God, that he would giue vs a law, by which we should be gouerned. For when man should consider his own basenes, and the infinite maiesty of God: he durst not verily serue God, if God should absolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, saying, serue me; nor should declare to him, what seruice did please him. For man might thinke with himselfe, hee were neuer able to please such a master: but God establishing to vs his law, hath deliuered vs from this trouble. Therefore the Prophet considering this great benefit, saith: For thy law I haue endured or sustained thee al the day long: that is, vnlesse that thou ô Lord hadst limited and put downe the seruice which thou wouldest haue me to do thee, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou hadst giuen me thy lawe; I shoulde haue beene at my wits ende, and verily haue fainted. Considering how my basenesse might serue such a great maiesty, and establishing me this law, thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me a heart, by which I may vnderstande, that I may easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this thing, and know what thou wouldest haue of me to bee done.</hi> Let vs all therefore marke the scriptures: no man knowes what things God delights in. Those thinges which seemes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in our eies,<note place="margin">Luke. 16.15 1 Sam. 15.15 1 Sam. 16.6.</note> are abhomination to the Lord: As <hi>Sauls</hi> sacrifice, and <hi>Samuels</hi> choise among the sonnes of <hi>Isay</hi> plainely declare. Let vs onelie do those thinges and workes, which Gods worde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs: those we are sure please him. As for other bee they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so religious in our owne eies, so costlie, so seuere and austere, vnlesse they be warranted by the word; surely they doe not please God. And this <hi>Philippus de Dies,</hi> being forced of truth, confesseth, as most true doctrine, which ouerthroweth all popish voluntaris seruing and worshipping of God, and confirmeth euerie true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian soule, in those christian exercises, which out of the worde it practiseth.</p>

For by them, the

The minde of the reader is as it were kindled, with the flames of holie examples. Shee seeth, what notable things haue been don by them, &amp; she doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie disdaine, because she doth not immitate the like. Wherefore it is excellentlie sayd to the spowse, by the bridgroome: Thy necke is like the tower of Dauid, which is builded with his castles; and a thousande shieldes hang about it, all the armor of the valiante: For the throte is in the necke, and in the throate is the voice: what therefore is mente by the throate of the church, but the holie worde of God? in which whyle a thousand bucklers are sayd to hang, by this perfect number, the whole number is shewed, because our whole armor is contained in the worde of God. There trulie are the commandements of God, there are the examples of righteous men. But to let passe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, which he there vrgeth, the examples which he settes before our eyes, are worth the marking: Being hurte of thy neighbour (saieth he) hast thou a desire through humilitie of minde, to continue in innocencie? Let Abell come before thine eies, who is read to haue been slaine of his brother: and yet he is not read to haue strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against him. Wouldst thou serue God, with a cleane heart, in the state of mariage? Set Enoch before thine eyes, who being married, walked with God, and was no more found; for God had translated him. Doest thou greatlie desire to prefer Gods commandements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine own present profit and commoditie? Sette Noah before thine eyes, who at Gods commandement making no great account of the care of his familie, a hundred yeeres liued occupied about buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the arke. Dost thou endeuor to take vpon thee the yoke of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? Looke vpon Abraham, who leauing his house, kinsfolkes &amp; countrie, obeied to go out to a strange place, which he should take to be his inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he should go: Who was willing for the euerlasting inheritance, to haue killed his dearely beloued sonne, whome hee had receiued of God for his heire. Wouldest thou be a simple and plaine dealing man? set <hi>Isaac</hi> before thine eies, whose plaine dealing greatly commended him in the sight of God. Doth paines taking and great labour delight thee? remember <hi>Iacob,</hi> who after hee had learned many yeares, with great labour and trauell, in frost and heate to serue man: hee came to that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6236:35"/> strength, that he coulde not be ouercome of an Angell, wrastling with him. Hast thou a desire to ouercome the intisementes of the flesh? let Ioseph come into thy minde, who, his mistres tempting him, studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keepe the chastitie of his bodie, with the daunger of his lyfe: whereof it came to passe, that he that knew well how to rule his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, was afterwarde made ruler ouer all Egypt. Doth patience and gentlenesse please thee? Call Moses to remembrance, who besides women and children gouerning six hundreth thousand fighting men, is reported to haue been the gentlest, the mildest man that euer was on the earth. Wouldst thou bee zealous in reprouing of sin, and in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting vices? Let Phinees be set before thine eyes, who running tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe with his sworde the two adulterers, (though they were Princes and great personages in their families) he made the people chast: and being angrie, he appeased the anger of God. Wouldest thou in thy doubtfull affaires trust of the hope and helpe of Almightie God assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie? Cal to remembrance Iosuah; who when he vndertooke doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full battelles, with an assured courage, he obtained the victorie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt. Dost thou desire to laie aside, all ill will and malice from thy heart, and now to enlarge thine heart through charity? think vppon Samuel, who being now put out of his office, by the people, and remoued from his princely authority, when as the same people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him, that he woulde praie to God for them: God forbid (saith he) that I shoulde cease to praie for you. The holie man thought, hee shoulde haue done a great fault, if to those, who were his enimies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to put him out of his kingdome, hee had not requited this fauour of praying for them. Who againe, when as he was sent of God to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint Dauid king, answered, how shall I go? For if Saul shall find me: he will kill me. And yet because he knew God was angrie with Saul, he wept so greatlie for him, that the Lorde saide to him being alone: How long wilt thou weepe for Saul, seeing I haue cast him from mee? Let vs consider, what a heat of charitie had inflamed his hearte, that wept for him, which would haue slaine him. We will beware of him, whom we are afraid of, and perchance (if occasion serue) we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite euill, for euill, to him we flie from. But let vs set Dauid before our eyes, who found the king that persecuted him, at such aduantage, that he might haue killed him; and yet in this aduantage he did to him the dutie he owed him, and not the euill he deserued: Saying; God forbid that I should laie my hand on the Lords annointed. And when the same Saul after was slaine of his enimies: him whom he had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6236:35"/> his persecutor as long as he liued, he lamented when he was slaine. Are we resolued to speake boldly to the mightie men of this world, when they doe amisse? let the authority of Iohn Baptist be called to our remembrance, who reprehending the wickednesse of Herod, for the vprightnesse of truth feared not death: and because Christ is truth, therfore, for Christ (that is for truth) he ventured his life. Do we earnestly desire to die for the Lord? Let vs remember Peter, who reioyced when he was whipped, being beaten he resisted the Princes, &amp; for life he despised his life, with a longing for of death. Do we desire to despise all aduersities? Let vs remember Paul, who not onely being readie to be bound, but to die for Christ, he accompted not his soule more pretious then him. Do we desire to haue our harts scorched with the heate of charity? Let vs way well the wordes of S. Iohn, of whom euery word that he spake, was (as it were) tanned with the fire of charity. Because in the word of God we seeke for the bulwarke of euery vertue: therfore there hanges in it, for young men, a thousand bucklers, all the armor of the valiant. For if wee will fight against the spirituall powers of wickednesse, let vs seeke for weapons of our defence, in the neck of the Church, which is built to vs as the tower of Dauid, that is, in the word of God, that by the direction of the commandement, the aide of helpe may bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against vices. Behold, we desire greatly euery one of vs, to be strong against the powers of the aire; in this tower, we finde the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of our soule: that from thence, we may take the precepts of our maker, and the examples of our forefathers, by the which we may be most assuredly armed, against our enemies. For whilst thou mindest to vndertake any vertue, and seest there, the same fulfilled of thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, there thou findest armor, by which thou maiest be defended against all spirituall warres. There hang shields on hie, that if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to fight, let him take them; and out of it, let him arme his heart with courage, and shoote out dartes of wordes.</hi> Thus far <hi>Gregory,</hi> teaching all Christians that the armour and weapons, not onelie against vices, but against our spirituall enemies: (whose chiefe assaults now are by heresies, to impugne the Church of Christ) are to be taken out of the scriptures. The faith which they teach, was the first faith, it was the Catholique faith: But the faith, which nowe many accompt for Catholique in our daies, and doe earnestlie embrace; was not the first faith, once giuen to the Saintes.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:6236:36"/>
               <p>And <hi>Gregory</hi> may seeme, to ground his opinion, not onelie of that mysticall sentence of <hi>Salomon</hi> in the <hi>Canticles:</hi> but also of the plaine testimonie of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> which thus writes to the <hi>Ephesians. We are not to wrastle against flesh and bloud:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.12.</note>
                  <hi>but against rule and power, against the rulers of the darkenes of this world, against the spirituall powers of wickednes, in heauenly places, which are alofte. Therefore take vnto you the whole Armor of God, that you may be able to resist them in that euill day, and stand, hauing quite vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all things.</hi> Let vs marke here first, howe the Apostle doeth teach all Christian soldiours, the whole armor of God. And hee calles it so twise, and he counsels them to take it to them, and to haue it in a readines. Secondly, howe he shewes the force of it, euen against all the darkenes and thicke mists, that the Prince of this world, shall cast vpon true Religion, and against all the sleightes and baites, wherewith he shall drawe vs to any firme: it shall be able to daunt all these assaultes, all these his dartes. And what would we haue more? These two onely are the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian bulwarkes, that sathan layeth siege against: Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Christian life. And this heauenly armor, which the holie scripture here teacheth vs, is not combrous or costly: it consistes but of seauen partes. The first is a girdle of trueth, though the profession thereof pinch vs, as it did <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> we ought to hate lying and dissimulation in our dealings. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a brest plate of righteousnes, to deale iustlie with all men, to giue euerie one that is due vnto him. The third is, shooes on our feet in the preparation of the gospell of peace, that is, through the comfort of the gospell, to be armed against all the sharp pricks and thornes of this life. Fourthlie, aboue all, to put on the shield of faith, wherby we may be able to extinguish all the fierie dartes of the wicked. That is, in one worde, that which <hi>Dauid</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 38.15. Psal. 130.3.</note>
                  <hi>Thou shalt answere for me O Lord my God:</hi> Whereas we are all bankerupts, <hi>we runne to Iesus Christ, and say thou shalt answere for me, O Lord my God. If thou Lord wilt be extreame, to marke what is done amisse, who is able to abide it?</hi> And this shield is able to quench all the fierie dartes of the wicked. What force soeuer Sathan layeth to our charge, Christes death is of more force. In him he could finde nothing:<note place="margin">Io. 14.30.</note> he can charge vs with no debt, but he hath performed it. Fiftlie, a helmet of saluation: that is, an assured hope of our saluation. Who will not endure any thing,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6236:36"/> if he hope that he shall be saued? Euen as a soldiour, hauing a helmet on his head will despise all blowes. Hereof saluation is called the wals and bulwarkes of the Church, <hi>Esay</hi> 60.18. which repels and puts to confusion all the inuasions and assaults of the enemy. And of these wals and bulwarkes consisteth the strength of the cittie. Sixtlie, the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. We must not onelie be armed to saue our selues, but also to wound our enemies: and that we may doe, with the worde of God. The which sword, how we should vse against him, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus in his combat with him, hath taught all his soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. And these thrée, we must haue aboue all thinges. First, the shielde of faith. Secondlie, the helmet of saluation. And thirdlie, the word of God, which all the Church of Rome almost hath quite taken from vs: as let any indifferent man iudge, looking into the daies of our fathers. And lastly, we must be not onely with our handes fighting, but also with our voice shouting and crying to God, against this enemie, with all manner of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and supplication. This is the complete harnesse of euerie true Christian soldiour. He that is thus armed, needes not feare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. He that lacketh this, (whatsoeuer hee hath besides) it will not serue his turne: not holy water nor <hi>agnus dei;</hi> not holy bread, nor holy bell, nor any such externall thing: We fight against spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and therefore we must thinke, that corporall things will not hurt them; no more than wooll will pierce yron.</p>
               <p>This may be the meaning of that which God taught <hi>Iob.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 40. ver. 20.21.22.</note>
                  <hi>Canst thou drawe out Leuiathan with an hooke, and with a line, which thou shalt cast downe vnto his tongue? Canst thou cast a hooke into his nose? Canst thou pierce his iawes with an angle? Will he make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praiers vnto thee, or speake thee faire? Will he make a couenant with thee, and wilt thou take him as a seruant for euer? &amp;c.</hi> That is, that as that great Leuiathan in the sea, cannot be taken by mans strength or cunning: much lesse sathan whose image he is. The Lords hand, and armor, &amp; power, must confound him, and tread him vnder our féet. This is that which <hi>S. Peter</hi> teacheth.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.8.</note>
                  <hi>Be sober and watch, for your aduersary the diuell, as a roaring lyon, walketh about, seeking whom he may deuour, whom resist stedfast in the faith.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but faith can withstand the Diuell: and this faith springeth out of the word of God, as <hi>S.

               <p>And here first generally, concerning this first faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  </gap>home God was pleased, haue kept it: and how Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath still gone about to depraue and corrupt it. God gaue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in paradise this first faith,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.15.</note> contained in his word: <hi>God put <hi>Adam</hi> in the garden, that he might dresse and keepe it: and the Lord commanded the man, saying: Thou shalt eat of euery tree in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, thou shalt not eate of it. For in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death.</hi> Here was the first faith, here was <hi>Adams</hi> religion or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of God. If he had kept this word, he, and all his posterity, had béene in paradise, till this day. But the subtill serpent, craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie créeping in, by withdrawing him from this word, by persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Eue</hi> shee should not die, shée should be a God: corrupted this first faith, and laide the corner stone of all Idolatrie, (which is, to depart from the word of God for any cause whatsoeuer) and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished man out of paradise, and all his progenie. Here you may plainlie see the first faith, and the false faith, which craftily crept in, yea the selfe same day as some thinke.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>32. v. 8.</hi> of <hi>Exodus,</hi> they made a calfe and worshipped it, euen by and by after the law was giuen. And they cried a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day vnto the Lord, and they remembred their deliuerance out of Egypt. Here were faire shewes, and here was golde, and a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday to the Lord, and great zeale, euen the pulling off of their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: but all this displeased God, they departed from his worde, he looked for no such seruice at their handes, hee condemned this their blinde zeale, because it was against his plaine and manifest commandement. When God had deliuered <hi>Israell</hi> out of Egypt, (which example the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> hereafter toucheth) and had drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their enemies, and had fed them with <hi>Mannah,</hi> and had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilously shewed his wonders amongst them, and brought them to the borders of the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> yet they which beléeued not his worde, they which cleaued not wholly to it: were destroied, and neuer entred into it. He promised that lande first to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob: Ioseph</hi> dying, being now setled in Egypt, in great dignitie and securitie; yet he beléeued this promise, and hoped no doubt assuredlie of the possession of it, and therefore gaue commandement, that his bones should be carried out with them, when they went. But this word, this promise afterwarde, his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6236:37"/> posterity beléeued not: euen then when they were come to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie entrance and taking possession of it. <hi>Iosuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> onely,<note place="margin">Num. 13.31.</note> who of the twelue spies that they sent to search the land, beléeued the promise of God, and encouraged them to go vp, and to fight against it: entred into it. But they beléeued the other tenne, against the word of God, who though they came home laden with the fruit of the land, persuaded them, that there were giants there, and great walled citties, and that they were not able to conquere it, and so they neuer entred into it. And were not the couetous, and faithlesse pastors and priests in popery, like these spies? Who had their backs laden with tenthes and commodities, as they had with grapes and figges: but they discouraged the hearts of their brethren; as these did. They taught them not to ground their faithes vpon the worde and promise of God, for the saluation of their soules, and obtaining of the kingdome of heauen. They taught them, as these did the Israelites, that their enemies were so mightie, &amp; that sathan was so strong, and that their sins were so great (which in many places of scripture are compared to wals or castles) that vnlesse they bought their masses, or gaue something to their Monasteries, they could not bee saued. Derogating and disabling that great promise of God concerning our saluation: that, <hi>whosoeuer beleeueth in Iesus Christ, hath eternall life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Io. 3.16. 1. Io. 5.12.</note> and shall enter into the true <hi>Canaan:</hi> though the walles of his sins he hath built, be as great as <hi>Paules,</hi> or as <hi>Peters,</hi> or as <hi>Mary Magdelens.</hi>

Here is sathans sleight, here is the false faith, here is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting of the faith once giuen to the saints. So that, to depart from gods word, not to cleaue to it alone; seem it neuer so strange, neuer so hard, neuer so much against our sence and reason; is the false faith. They had tenne against two, they had their eies to perswade them, they sawe giants and walled citties: but they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6236:38"/> lacked faith, and so they died all in the wildernesse.</p>

                  <hi>gathered to him all the elders of Iudah, and Ierusalem, and the king went vp into the house of the Lord: and all the men of Iudah, and all the inhabitants of Ierusalem with him, and the priestes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their eares, all the wordes of the booke of the couenant, which was found in the house of the Lord: And the king made a couenant before the Lord, that they should walke after the Lorde, and keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all their hart, and with all their soule, that they might establish, and make good the wordes of the couenant, written in this booke: and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ratified, and established this couenant.</hi> Here is first the lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority of princes, to cause Gods worde to be preached and taught, and to cause the priests to doe their dueties: euen to make the people sweare, and make a couenant with God, that they will neuer forsake his word, but will euen worshippe him, as his word commandeth. He did this according to the lawe <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.12. where God commanded that the lawe should be read to men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children. This authoritie our prince hath: she may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell our recusants to come and heare the lawe of God read, and preached, as this good king <hi>Ezechiah</hi> did; if it please her maiestie. For no doubt, many in <hi>Iosias</hi> time, that had béene nourished in idolatrie and superstition, those seauentie yeares after the death of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> and delighted in those high places they had built, and in that golden groue or wood, as is likelie,<note place="margin">Verse. 6.</note> which was placed in the temple, which <hi>Iosiah</hi> burnt, and stamped to powder; came vp to heare the lawe read, against their wils.

His subiects obeyed him, and why should not they obey her?</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is the true religion, to worship God according to his word, vtterly to abolish all buildings, foundations, works, vessels, be they neuer so costlie, or stately, which haue béene ordai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, yea of kings, against the lawe of God. And this reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the part of kings to doe, it is the chiefe thing, they are to looke to: yea &amp; euen to require an oath of their subiects, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this religion for euer.

Here is that seruice and religion, which many Recusants at this daie, refuse to be present at, as plainlie set downe as maie be: That is, reading of the word to all, to men, women and children, a pulpit of wood ordained for the preaching and expounding of the same, and praiers and praises to God, with vnderstanding, in a knowne tongue; so that the people cryed, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Amen. What can be more plaine than this? Is not this the very forme of seruice and praier, which our Church vseth at this daie? and yet some are offended at it. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Esrah</hi> the priest and scribe, and the Leuites, that instructed the people, said to all the people: <hi>This day is holy to the Lord: Mourne not,</hi>

                  <hi>for this day is holy vnto our Lord, be ye not sory therefore: for the ioy of the Lord is your strength.</hi> Here are also two notable lessons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Sabaoth, for all Christians to learne. First to reioyce in the Lord, and in his word, that they haue heard: to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon it, and to receiue it with ioy. Let all Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of wordlie carefulnesse, of sorrowe: <hi>For the ioy of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.9.</note>
                  <hi>is their strength.</hi> It is not gellies or preseruatiues, or meates; that maketh man strong: but the ioye of the Lord. Secondlie, in the Sabaoth, they should haue care on the poore: euerie one should bid his poore neighbour to dinner with him, for whom nothing is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, or else send him something; if he haue but one dish, to send somewhat thereof to the poore. So did <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 31.17.</note>
                  <hi>who neuer eat his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell</hi> (that is as we terme it, his small pittance) <hi>alone:</hi> but the poore, the widowe, not on the sabaoth onlie, but also on other daies, <hi>had part of it with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like religion and forme of seruice was vsed in our sauiour Christes time. For thus wee read: <hi>And hee came to Nazareth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 4.16.</note>
                  <hi>where he had been brought vp, and as his custome was, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the synagogue on the Sabaoth day, and stood vp to read, and there was deliuered him, the booke of the Prophet Esay.</hi> Here we may learne first, that Christ himselfe went to the Church, and that the scriptures were read and expounded to the people, and that this was a chiefe part of their seruice; and that euerie Sabaoth day, it was his custome, to preach and teach the people. And here also,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6236:41"/> this custome of our sauiour, to preach euerie sabaoth, should all faithfull and true pastors learne, amongst their other customes of tithes and dueties, which they narrowly looke after. The same forme of seruice was continued in the Church in the Apostles time: for thus we reade of the whole Church of Christ, which were conuerted by the Apostles to the faith.<note place="margin">Act. 3.42.</note>
                  <hi>And they continued in the Apostles doctrine, fellowship or communion, and breaking of bread and praiers.</hi> Here are the chiefe parts of Gods religion, faith to the word preached; communication of things necessarie, or christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity, to their brethren, as well preachers as others; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the sacraments, and praiers. And that their praiers were in a tongue knowne,<note place="margin">Act. 4.24.</note> we read thus: <hi>That when they were comen from the councell, they tolde their fellowes, all that the priestes and elders had said vnto them. And when they heard it, they lift vp their voices, with one accord: and said, &amp;c.</hi> How could they haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one accorde, if they had not knowne, what they praied? And that the reading of the scriptures in a knowne tongue, and preaching of them to the people after also continued, thus we read. <hi>And after the lecture of the lawe and prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 13.15.</note>
                  <hi>the ruler of the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, sent vnto them saying: ye men and brethren, if ye haue any word of exhortation to the people, say on.</hi> Here is the lawe and prophets first read, and afterward preached and expounded. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> after in his exhortation vnto them, affirmeth the same: for (saith he) <hi>the inhabitants of Ierusalem and their rulers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 27.</note>
                  <hi>because they knew him not; nor yet the wordes of the prophets which are read e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sabaoth day, they haue fulfilled them, in condemning him.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>S. Iames</hi> confirmeth the same, that this hath beene an auncient custome to heare the scriptures reade and expounded to the people.<note place="margin">Act. 15.21.</note>
                  <hi>For Moses</hi> (saith he) <hi>of olde, in euery citty hath them which preach him, being read euery sabaoth day in their synagogues.</hi> So that then this is the ancient and true Catholique religion, to haue the scriptures read and taught vnto the people: and yet they which pretend the name of Catholiques, accompt this the newe religion, wil not heare the scriptures, will not come to that church where they are read and preached.</p>
               <p>That last fare well of <hi>Iosua</hi> to the Rubenites, Gadits, and halfe tribe of manasses,<note place="margin">Ios. 22.5.</note> when hee sent them home, is worth the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>returne and go to your tabernacles, to the land of your possession, which the seruant of the Lord <hi>Moses,</hi> gaue you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

Onely marke diligently, that you doe the precepts and the law, which <hi>Moses</hi> the seruant of the Lord commanded: that you loue the Lorde your God, that you walke in all his waies, and that you keepe his commandements, and that you cleaue to him, and that you serue him with all your heart, and with all your soule: And <hi>Iosuah</hi> blessed them, and sent them away.</hi> Here is liuelie set down the office of the magistrate, to command that his subiectes obey the law of God: Here is the platforme of true religion; to obey the law of God onely; there néedes no more. And this law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be kept, vnlesse it be taught and heard: and therefore the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and hearing is here also necessarily inferred.</p>

                  <note place="margin">In Nouellis de eccl. diuersis capit.</note> We command all Bishops and Priestes, that they celebrate the holy oblation, and the prayer vsed in baptisme, not with a lowe, but with a lowde and cleere voice, which may be heard of the people, that thereby with more deuotion the mindes of the hearers may bee lift vp, in shewing forth the praises of God. For so the holy Apostle teacheth: Truly if thou onely blesse in the spirit, how shall he that is a priuate man at thy giuing of thankes say that Amen to God, seeing he knoweth not what thou saiest? Thou giuest thankes wel: but the other is not edified. <hi>And againe,</hi> with the heart it is beleeued to righteousnesse; but with the mouth is confession made to saluation. For these causes it is meete that amongst other praiers, they which are sayd in the holy oblation, shoulde bee pronounced with a lowde

                  <hi>And in the preface of the commentaries of</hi> Augustine <hi>on the Psalmes, it is thus written.</hi> That God therefore made man, that there should be some, that should vnderstand his workes, which should in his vnderstanding wonder at, with his voice shew forth and praise, the prouidence of his disposing all thinges, the reason of his doing, the force of his finishing, and bringing thinges to passe, the power of his preseruing, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wisdom of his gouerning, &amp; the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his doing good to all: And this is, to worship God our maker. As the world was made for man to serue him: so was man made for God, to serue him. <hi>(And after)</hi> He hath deliuered vs out of the handes of our enimies, that we might serue him, without feare all the daies of our life. This seruice of God enioined mā, though it may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waies be expounded, and yeelded to God the creator: yet it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the worship due vnto God. And this is nothing else, then his deuout praise. The chiefe custome of worshipping God, (Lactantius being witnesse) is praise, out of the mouth of a iust man, directed to God. The which it selfe (he saieth) that it maie be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, we haue need of great humilitie, feare, and deuotion, least any perchance hauing the trust of integritie and innocencie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the fault of pride and arrogancie, and by that meanes lose the grace of his vertue. Therefore Moses after he had put downe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer commandement, he addeth, thou shalt cleaue to him; he is thy praise, that is, whom alone thou must praise. This is true religion, this is right godlinesse, this is the right seruice of God. This is that accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and continuall sacrifice, with which God will be worshipped, pacified, honored, and glorified: as he witnesseth by his prophet, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to God the sacrifice of praise,<note place="margin">Prolog. Aug. in lib. Psal.</note> &amp;c. <hi>And in the prologue</hi> Augustine <hi>writes thus.</hi> All scripture inspired from aboue, is apt to teach: And for this cause is written of the holie Ghost, that as it were out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fountaine of health, we should all out of this, take remedies for our proper griefes. <hi>(And after)</hi> The prophets teach some things, and the lawe other things, and the histories other things, and the doctrine of the Prouerbs other things; but the booke of the Psalmes, out of them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6236:44"/> all, conteines what soeuer things are profitable. <hi>(And after)</hi> The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Psalmes are made fit for vs by tunes, that either in our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or they which are young men in manners, as it were singing psalmes, might be delighted. For manie of them which come to the church, neither can easilie learne either the precepts of the prophets, or Apostles; or when they haue learned them, can keepe them in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: but the answeres of the Psalmes, they sing at home sometime, and commonlie abroad, among the people. And if any be taken with any furious or cruel rage, if he shal be (as <hi>I</hi> may so say) inchaunted with the verses of the Psalme, by and by, all the rage of his fury departeth. <hi>(And after):</hi> Who will any more call him his enemy, with whom he hath lift vp one voice to God in the psalme? Whereby appeareth that the psalme restoreth charitie, which is the best thing in the worlde, making an vnitie, by the consent of the voice, and consorting diuers people of one companie, by concorde, through their common sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. A psalme driueth away deuilles, calleth Angels to helpe vs. It is the first letter to beginners in Christ schoole; the profiting of them, that go forwardes; the sure foundation of the perfect; and the one voice of the whole church. Psalmes beautifie our holy daies, psalmes mitigate Godlie sorrowe, psalmes will moue yea euen a hearte of stone, to teares. A psalme is the worke of Angels, the exercise of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly soldiers, and spirituall frankinsence. O wise ordenance of our wonderfull master, that we may both sing, and may bee taught also, what things are good for our soule. If any thing be put in our minde hardly and by force, they straight way slip out againe: but those things we receiue with loue and delight, I cannot tell, how they more settle in our minds and sticke better in our memories. And what is it, that is not learned in the psalmes? Doth not y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> greatnes of al vertues, the square of iustice, the beautie of chastitie, the perfection of wisedome, the rule of patience: doth not euery thing, which may be called good, proceed of them? <hi>And againe in the preface thus wee reade:</hi> This booke of Psalmes is as it were the register of all the holy scripture, and the perfection of all diuinitie. And when as wee must sing to God with our vnderstanding, howe can hee sing to God duly, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what he singeth? For our holie Psalmist commaundes vs to sing to God, with our vnderstanding. <hi>And that we must sing Psalmes with our vnderstanding, and not deskant vpon them without knowledge, (as they haue done heretofore in the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their popish musick) this place plainly proueth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here we may plainlie sée why man was made, to knowe the workes of God, and to praise him for them; and that the chiefe part of Gods seruice is, his praise; and that we ought to praise him alone, in psalmes and hymnes, and that this is true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that singing of Psalmes, driues away deuils, not ringing of holie bels, as was vsed in time of poperie; and that they song psalmes together in the Church, and also at home in their houses. To conclude, that the psalmes, are as an Apothecaries shoppe, containing medicines for all diseases of afflicted soules. And in</hi> S. Augustines <hi>daies the people with the pastor song psalmes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as appeareth in his exposition vpon the psalmes in diuers places, which prooueth manifestlie that their common praiers were in a tongue knowne to the people. For thus he writeth:</hi> Hauing beseeched the Lord,<note place="margin">In psal. 18.</note> that he would clense vs from our secret sinnes, and that he would spare vs as concerning other mens sins, we must vnderstand what this meaneth, that we may sing with reason like men, and not chatter like birdes. For blackbirdes, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, and crowes, and pies, and such like birdes, are often taught of men, to pronounce that, which they know not: but to sing by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by Gods will, is granted to man, not to birdes. And we know and lament, howe many wicked and riotous men sing so, thinges meete for their own eares and hearts: and they are so much the more wicked, because they cannot be ignorant of those thinges they sing. For they know, they sing that which is nought, and yet they sing (the more filthy the song is) the more willingly: because they thinke they are so much the more merry, as they are dishonest and filthie. But we which haue learned to sing Gods word in the Church, wee must also be instant, that we may be that which is written: Blessed is that people that singeth with vnderstanding. Therefore (beloued) that which we haue song with agreeing voices, we ought to knowe and perceiue with a pure heart. Euery one of vs in this psalme hath beseeched God and hath said, O Lord clense me from my secret sins, and spare thy seruant from other mens offences: if mine shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ouer me, then I shall be cleane, and shall be clensed, from the great offence. The which, that we may vnderstand what and what kinde this is, let vs runne ouer briefely, as God shall giue vs leaue, the text of the psalme. <hi>Here</hi> S. Augustine <hi>teacheth plainlie, that man must not sing like parrats or birdes, they must knowe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they sing. The verie wicked knowe and vnderstand
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6236:45"/> their songs: and shall not Gods children? And this doctrine he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth in other places: For in another place thus he speaketh to his hearers:</hi> This psalme, as we haue song with you with ioyfulnes: so I beseech you consider it with vs with attentiuenesse. <hi>And after,</hi> This is written, and we haue declared where it is written:<note place="margin">In psal. 44.</note> they which remember it, let them acknowledge it, they which doe not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, let them read it: they which haue not read it, let them beleeue it. <hi>And in another place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Psal. 147.</note> you remember <hi>(beloued)</hi> the psalme which we haue song, where we haue deserted the exposition thereof to this. <hi>And againe:</hi> Blessed are the people that knoweth how to reioice in thee: let vs all runne to this blessing,<note place="margin">In Psal. 99.</note> let vs vnderstand our praise and reioycing: let vs not power it out, without vnderstanding. <hi>And spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the excellencie of singing psalmes against the</hi> Donatists, <hi>and of the maner of praying &amp; singing in the Church of Aphrica, he writes thus:</hi> When <hi>(saieth he)</hi> is not the time to sing,<note place="margin">Epist. <hi>119.</hi> ad Ianuar.</note> when the brethren are assembled in the Church: but either when there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or preaching, or the chiefe pastor praieth himselfe with a lowd voice, or else common praiers are proclaimed, or denounced, by the Deacons: at other times, what can be better done of Christians as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together, then singing of Psalmes? What thing more holy, I knowe not. <hi>So that here may seeme to be set downe the chiefe partes of diuine seruice, in</hi> S. Augustines <hi>daies, reading the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, preaching, praier of the pastor with a cleare voice, that all might heare and vnderstand, common praier of the people, and singing of psalmes.

                  <hi>the scriptures were read in a tongue knowne to the people, and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the reading of the Epistle to</hi> Timothy, <hi>he beginneth thus:</hi> You haue heard the voice of the Apostle, the heauenly trumpet, the spirituall harpe: you haue heard him to daie, discoursing to Timothy, of many and necessarie thinges, of elections, of drinking wine for his stomacke, of the obedience of seruants, and of many other things he hath discoursed to vs this day, and seeing we cannot runne ouer them all, what will you of these things which haue beene rehearsed, I shall declare vnto you (beloued?) For as in a great meadowe, I see many excellent flowers: (Nay not a meadowe; but euen Paradise it selfe, the garden of God, is the reading of the scriptures.

                  <hi>that will banish himselfe from thence? And in another place he writeth thus:</hi> The cunning in the scriptures, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing (my beloued.) This endueth the soule with good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, this transporteth our minde into heauen, this maketh a man thankefull to God, this maketh vs regard nothing in this world, but that we should haue our conuersation in heauen, and hauing an eie to God our reward, it maketh vs doe all things, and ioyfully to attempt, euen the hard labours of vertue. By these we learne, the helpe of God, euen present and at hand, the courage of the iust, the goodnes of the Lord, the greatnes of his rewardes. Hereby we may bee stirred vp, to follow the liues of the best saints of God; not to be slouthfull in the combates of vertue, to be sure of Gods promises, euen before they come. Therfore with great diligence, let vs giue our selues to the reading of the scriptures, for thereby we shall get great knowledge, if wee shall still haue recourse to those thinges which therein are set downe. <hi>Who will not now learne so many good lessons? And least anie man should blame the hardnesse and obscuritie of the scriptures, as many doe; thus it followeth:</hi> Neither is it possible, that he that giueth himselfe to the scriptures, with great studie, and earnest desire, shall alwaies be neglected: but although wee lacke a master to teach vs, the Lord himselfe from aboue, entring our hearts, doth lighten our mindes, doth power his beames into our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, doth reueale things hid, and doth teach vs those thinges wee know not, if we only will bring, as much as in vs lieth. For he saith, you shall call no man master vpon earth: that is, in comparison of me, who am able and euer willing to teach. Therefore when we take this heauenly booke into our hands, all worldly cares being set aside; let vs bend the force of our minde, and bridle it, that it be not distracted with vaine cogitations; and let vs giue our selues to reading, with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6236:47"/> great deuotion and marking, that we may be lead by the holy spirit, to the true vnderstanding of the scriptures, and thereby reape much fruit. That same Barbarian and Eunuch of the Queene of Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, which was so honourable, and was caried in his chariot; at that time, did not omit the reading of the scriptures, but hauing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his hands, he studied earnestly, and that being ignorant, what was contained in the booke: and he brought as much as was in him, that is, studie, a good will, and diligent marking. Marke I beseech you, what a matter this was, not to giue ouer his reading, no not in his iourney, and that sitting in his chariot. Therefore, they are iustly to be found fault withall, which being at home, cannot be persuaded to doe this, but thinke, that they neede not read the scriptures; either because they are married men, or souldiers, or haue care of children, and seruants, or other businesse: Therfore they thinke, it behooueth not them to reade the scriptures. Behold this man was an Eunuch, and a Barbarian (which both, had been enough to haue made him carelesse) and besides this, the greatnesse of his honour, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his wealth, as also being in his iourney, and being caried in a chariot; and he that traueileth thus, it is not easie for him to reade, but verie troublesome: notwithstanding his great desire, and earnest studie, taking all lets away, made him reade still.<note place="margin">This same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles at large, ho. 2. <hi>in Mat.</hi> and ho. 9. <hi>ad Col.</hi> where he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to buy them bibles, and if not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet at least the new Testament.</note> Wherfore he did not say as many say now adaies, I vnderstand not these thinges which are written, I cannot vnderstand the depth of the scriptures, wherfore in vaine I should take paines, I haue none to guide me: He thought no such thing, being in language a Barbarian, but in heart a louer of wisedome; but he thought he should not be despised, but helped of Gods grace, if he brought that which was in him, that is, studie and diligence. Whom also let vs followe; and what thinges haue beene read to vs to daie, let vs learne diligently. <hi>This place being long, I haue written it at large, because it is so excellent; it containeth the great fruite and profite we get by reading the scriptures, the meanes how to attaine the knowledge of them: and it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> common obiection which now adaies manie make, That because they haue wife and children, they are not bounde to reade the scriptures: and ouerthroweth plainelie, the popish Catholique faith, which teacheth, that the vulgar people should not reade the scriptures, and teacheth the true catholique saith indéed. And this is no small or light matter, but the chiefe point of all religion; as euerie one maie perceiue, by the benefites which are reaped by

                  <hi>The same catholique faith was also in <hi>Augustines</hi> daies: For thus he writes against those, that finde fault with the hardnesse of the scriptures, vpon that verse of the Psalme:</hi> The Lord taketh vp the meeke, for example sake <hi>(saith he)</hi> Thou vnderstandest not the scriptures, thou vnderstandest but a little of them, thou knowest not what it meaneth: yet honour the scriptures of God, honour the word of God, although it be not manifest vnto thee: defer, through deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thy vnderstanding. Be not froward to accuse, either the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or peruersitie of the scriptures. Here is nothing peruerse, or out of order, or crooked: but here is some thing obscure, not that thou shouldest not know it, but that it should exercise thee, before thou receiue it. Therefore when it is obscure, thy phisition hath done that, that thou mightest knocke; he would haue thee exercised in knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his will is that when thou knockest or praiest, he will open vnto thee: By knocking, thou shalt be exercised, and by exercise thou shalt be made more strong, and more large: and being made wider, thou shalt be made capable of that which is giuen thee. Therefore be not angrie, that it is shut vp: be gentle, be courteous, do not kick against obscure places, and say it had better, haue beene said this, or thus.

                  <hi>AS concerning Images, either of God himselfe, or of the saintes, to be worshipped: there is no one thing, that the scripture more condemneth. It is the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the lawe:</hi> Thou shalt not make to thee any grauen Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them. <hi>They, which vrge the bare words and letter so much in the Lords supper, here make small accompt of it (being so often repeated, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, with Gods owne finger) to maintaine their superstition and Idolatrie. And this commandement is repeated and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4.15.</note> And the Lord spake vnto you out of the fire, and ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, but a voice ye heard: <hi>as though he should saie, ye sawe no similitude of God, when he gaue the lawe, but ye heard a voice onelie: Therefore you shall make no Image or likenesse of God. For a voice cannot be pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. And here the word <hi>(Temunah)</hi> which signifieth an Image or likenesse, is to be marked, which after is repeated so often. For so it followeth, that they should looke well to their soules, because they sawe no similitude when God spake vnto them in</hi> Horeb <hi>out of the middest of the fire, least perchance beeing deceiued, they should make to themselues, anie carued worke, or likenesse or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, or Image. Anie likenesse, the similitude of man, or woman. So that, this hearing a voice onelie, which cannot bee pictured; this séeing no Image or likenesse or similitude, when God spake to them; this carefull keeping of their soules, least they should be deceiued; this multiplying of these wordes, of carued worke, likenesse, similitude, Image; argueth plainlie, that nor likenesse of God is to be made: and that Images of him are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by this commandement, and not of Idolatrous Gods, as the Papists imagine and expound.

And what is that? an inuisible power which ruleth ouer the Image. By making this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for their images (<hi>saith</hi> Augustine) they seeme wise to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And they which doe not worship Idols, worship deuils. <hi>And after he writes thus:</hi> Tell me what spirits thou worshippest. Tell me, doest thou worship deuils, or good spirits? such as are Angels. For there are euill spirits, and good angels. I tell thee (<hi>saith</hi> Augustin) that in thy Churches, there are none other worshipped, but euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6236:55"/> which proudlie do require to themselues sacrifices, and will haue themselues worshipped as gods. They are euill, they are proud. Such are as diuels, men which seeke their own glorie, &amp; despise the glory of God. But marke good men, which are like to the Angels, when thou shalt find a good man a seruaunt of God: if thou wilt worship him &amp; adore him, for God; he forbids thee; he will not take to himself the honour of God, he will not be a God to thee: but with thee he will be vnder God. Thus did the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, when men would haue sacrificed vnto them. <hi>And after:</hi> Marke therefore, how these men forbadde them that woulde worship them as Gods; and they will rather that one God only to be worshipped, one God be adored, to one God sacrifice be offered, &amp; not to them. So al the saints and Angels seeke his glorie, whom they loue; they studie to inflame all men whom they loue, to his worship, to pray to him, to meditate vppon him. They declare him vnto them, not themselues, because they are his messengers. And because they are Gods souldiers, they cannot but seeke the glorie of their captaine. Augustine <hi>denyeth this worshipping of saintes, and he expoundes what this worship was, to offer them sacrifices, to pray vnto them? No, he alloweth not anie worship vnder an image, as the heathen did. And</hi> Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>writes thus:</hi> We haue here need to expound the word <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore, when I shall make an image of the image, that is my soule, and shall make her greate in thought and word, then I make a great image of God; and then the Lord, whose image is in our soule, is magnified. And as God by this meanes encreaseth in our soule: so if wee be sinners, he is diminished and decreaseth. <hi>Here wee maie sée what images were in</hi> Origens <hi>daies, Iesus Christ is the image of God the father, and euerie Christians soule, as neare as maie bee, is to bee pictured like to him.

               <p>This is that which we learne out of the gospell, that all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Apostles, haue receiued power of forgiuing sinnes:<note place="margin">Io. 20.23.</note> and to them all, hath our Sauiour saide and not to <hi>Peter</hi> onelie, <hi>Whose sinnes you forgiue they are forgiuen, and whose sinnes you retaine, they are retained.</hi> This is that which <hi>S.

                  <hi>Olde thinges are passed away, behold all thinges are made newe, and all these thinges are of God, who hath reconciled vs to himselfe, by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and hath giuen vnto vs the ministerie of this reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That is to say, <hi>because God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himselfe, not imputing vnto them their sinnes, and hath put in vs the word of reconciliation: In Christes steede therefore, we are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, and as though God did beseech you by vs, we pray you most earnestly, that you would bee reconciled to God.</hi> This place first, ouer throweth the doctrine of mans free will, which teacheth, that we are onelie helped by the grace of God, whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saieth, we are created, all thinges are newe, and all things are of God: nothing then of our selues. Secondlie, that God hath in Iesus Christ reconciled the whole world to himselfe. And that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6236:58"/> all ministers and pastors, are Gods embassadours in Christes stéede, and in them, he put this worde of reconciliation, this his most gratious, generall and free pardon, that whosoeuer beléeueth this glad tidings of the sonne of God, dying, and rising againe, for our sins; shall haue pardon and frée remission of all his sins, shall be reconciled to God, shall not haue his sinnes imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. So that then, euerie minister hath his worde of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation committed vnto him: hath this power of proclaiming this generall pardon, to all true penitent sinners: not the Pope onelie, as he séemeth to challenge. And euerie one, that heareth and beleeueth this our embassage, this our message, hath the force thereof, that is, the remission of his sinnes, firmelie assured to him and sealed, not with a bull of lead, as the Popes pardons are,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.5.</note> but with the spirit of God: as we reade, <hi>God hath adopted vs to himselfe, through Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note>
                  <hi>to the praise of the glorie of his grace.</hi> And againe, <hi>by whome we haue redemption through his bloud,<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> euen the forgiuenesse of sins, according to his rich grace.</hi> And againe, <hi>In whom we are chosen, that first trusted in Christ, and that we should be to the praise of his glorie.

Here is the gospell, the worde of reconciliation, the tydings it bringeth of this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: here is the seale of this pardon and reconciliation euen the spirit of God: here is the ende thereof often repeated; that wee all should be, to the praise of the glorie of God: That is, that we all should praise the great mercie, and pitie, and gratious goodnes of our God, who so freelie, and willinglie hath pardoned so manie, so notorious, so vndeserued sinners. Now if this power laie in the Pope, we should haue cause to praise him.</p>
               <p>And of this pardon, and of the meanes to obtaine the same, that is faith in Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.9.</note> we read. <hi>Rom. 10.9. This is the word of faith which we preach, That is to saie, if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth, the Lord Iesus, and beleeue in thy hearte, that God raised him from the deade, thou shalt be saued. For with the heart wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to iustification, and with the mouth we confesse to saluation.</hi> Here is iustification, the acquittance and pardon of our sinnes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6236:58"/> and saluation of our soules. And this word, this pardon (saieth the Apostle) is neare vs, we néede not go to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for it; as the Iewes were compelled to do, in their sinnes, and trespasses, and there to offer sacrifices, and so to obtaine pardon; much lesse to Rome, or anie other place: we are now fréede from this burthen: It is now at home with vs, nay in our mouthes, and in our harts. To buy the Popes pardons, is to distrust this pardon, to go so far for the word of our saluation, is to denye the Apostle, who saieth, it is men at home amongst vs, euen in our hearts.

                  <hi>Some Bishoppes here, our prodecessors</hi> (saieth he) <hi>in our prouince thought not, that repentance should be graunted to adulterers, and altogether shut vp the place of repentance against adultery: but yet these depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not from the society of their fellow Bishoppes, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> addeth there a little after. <hi>But if that which is trueth, the church by good right holdeth, peace is to be graunted rightlie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers repenting: they which shut vp all place of repentance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst adulterers, did indeed wickedlie, which denyed health to the members of Christ, and withdrew the keyes of the church from them, which knocked to haue gone in; and withstood the most mercifull

And of this repentance the same <hi>Augustine</hi> writes thus after: <hi>Neither thinke thou, that any can come from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to truth, or from any great or small sinne to correction, without repentance. But it is a very impudent errour, hereof to slander the church, which by so many diuine testimonies, is euident to bee the church of Christ, that she deales with them otherwise, that doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake her, if they correct their fault after by repentance: and otherwise with those, that were neuer in her, and then first of all embrace her peace, by humbling those former more: by receiuing these more gently; and louing both of them, in doing her diligence, to heale them both, with a motherly affection.</hi> And of extortioners, <hi>Epist.</hi> 54. he writes thus: <hi>We reproue them, we detest them, we depriue them, of the communion of the holie altar, &amp;c.</hi> Here is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of such notorious extortioners and couetous persons, as being able to make restitution, would not. So that to all sinners notoriouslie knowne, the Church as it should séeme, according to the greatnesse of their sinnes, laide this rod of open repentance, that they might be cured.

Let Papists, and counterfeit catholiques take héed, which will not heare his word, nor thinke they are bound to know and vnderstand it; least by this their obstinacie and stopping their eares, they go not into purgatorie, but into hell.

               <p>Secondlie, the doctrine of purgatorie is against the authoritie of Christ: for he saith, <hi>Father I will, that they which thou hast giuen me, be with me euen where I am,</hi>

And therfore no doubt vpon the gospell groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his faith, he saith, <hi>I desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ.</hi> This was the cause, he desired to be loosed out of the bonds of this sinfull flesh, that he might be with Christ: as our sauiour here hath promised, and not to him onelie; but to all that his father hath giuen him, to all his. And in another place, <hi>S. Paul</hi> speaking of all Christians saith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.1.</note>
                  <hi>We know that if our earthly house of this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle were dissolued, we haue a building of God, a house made without hands, euerlasting in heauen.</hi> So that then, christians haue but two houses or homes: This earthlie tabernacle of the fleshe, and when that is dissolued, an house of God, an house in heauen.

Tim. 6.10.</note> banishing from his church mysticallie the root of all euill, couetousnes. This wood the Apostle speaketh of, which also hee calleth Idolatrie, because the couetous man maketh his monie, his God. The preachers of the gospell must not build vpon Iesus Christ, this wood; must not plant neare his Altar, this roote of all euill, and huge greate tree with her manie branches, couetousnes: neither by their wordes, nor by their examples. For if they do, their works shall burne, and they themselues shall be hardlie saued, euen as it were thorowe the fire. Greene grasse also maie resemble the ease and pleasures of this lyfe. In May the fieldes are gréene, pleasant and full of fragrant flowers, and men then do delight, to take their ease in them. They therefore builde gréene grasse vppon Iesus Christ, which doe giue themselues to pleasures and ease, which preach not, which labour not in the Lordes vineyearde, and so by their euill example, are offence to others: or else which preach ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to their hearers, plausible and pleasant doctrine; which preach the promises, and not the precepts of the gospell.

                  <hi>We are kept</hi> (saith he) <hi>through faith, to that great saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ready and prepared to be reuealed in the last time, against which time,</hi> either of our deathes, or of the great iudgement, <hi>we reioice: yet a little while (if need be)</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Our afflictions are louing, 1. corrections and purgings, 2. trials, 3. crownes.</note>

And of the same triall he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6236:70"/> in another place:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.12.</note>
                  <hi>My beloued</hi> (saith he) <hi>account not your fiery trial, as though some strange thing chanced vnto you: But as you are partakers of Christs sufferings reioice, that in the reuelation of his glorie, you may triumphing, bee glad.</hi> As Christ suffered nothing after his death, but all in this life: so all his members in some measure, shall suffer, to be made like vnto him. <hi>And herein</hi> (saith <hi>Peter) let them reioice.</hi> Nowe to saie that his members shoulde suffer after death, were to make them vnlike vnto their head. So that, it is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fierie triall, which <hi>S. Peter</hi> appoints to all christians, if néed be; which no doubt the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of in this place. And this is that, which he himselfe teacheth vs also plainlie, to the <hi>Corinthians: If we would iudge our selues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.31.</note>
                  <hi>we should not be iudged of the Lord; but now we are corrected of him, least we should bee damned with the world.</hi> So that then, those Christians which doe not iudge themselues, which doe not repent sufficientlie of their sinnes, by <hi>S. Paules</hi> iudgment, and plaine testimonie, are here in this life iudged of God, and scourged with manie afflictions, least they should be condemned with the world. And therefore for such, no fire of purgatorie then remaineth, after this life: as the papists imagine. <hi>S. Peter</hi> also teacheth vs the same: <hi>That God beginneth first to punish, to purge and sweepe (as it were) his owne house, in this life: and afterward, the wicked in hell for euer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. v. 17.</note>
                  <hi>Now is the time</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the iudgment should beginne with the house of God, and if first with vs, what shall bee the ende of them, which beleeue not the gospell of Iesus Christ?</hi> So that then, God iudgeth and punisheth the faultes and falles, both of his shéepe, and of the wicked goats: but of his, in this life; of the wicked in hell. Of this sauing also,<note place="margin">Psal. 66. v. 11.</note> as it were through the fire, <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh: <hi>We went through fire and water, &amp; thou broughtest vs into a wealthy place:</hi> that is through the affliction and troubles of this life; whereof some were as hoat as fire, and some as huge as water. And of this triall by fire in the hearers of his word, our Sauiour speaketh: <hi>Some seedes</hi> (saith he) <hi>fell among stones where they had not much earth, and they sprung vp quickly because they had not depth of earth: but when the sunne arose, they were scorched with heat, and because they had not depth of earth they withered away.</hi> And what this heate meaneth he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes expoundes: <hi>That which fell among stones is hee, which heareth the word, and receiueth it gladly:</hi>

And yet this vniustice, the papists séeme to lay vpon God, by their doctrine of purgatorie: whereas they teach, that the soule is punished alone, in those sinnes which it committed in the bodie.</p>

                  <hi>that God in this life scourgeth and whippeth euerie sonne whom he receiueth.</hi> And therefore saith he knowing this, <hi>Let vs lift vp our hands which hang downe, and our weake knees, and make streight steps to our feete:</hi> As though he should saie, let vs be of good courage, and though we be afflicted, yet walke lustelie in the waie of the Lorde, and doe his workes couragiously. And here first this lifting vp of handes, and this making streight steps to our féete, prooueth plainlie, that this scourging the Apostle speaketh of, is in this life.

And therefore <hi>S.

                  <hi>whilst thou art in the way with him?</hi> His answere is, <hi>that the aduersary of the soul, is the body; for these are aduersaries th'one to th'other; as S. Paul saith, we doe chasten it, and doe bring the body into subiection, by fastings, watchings, and by other afflictions: and we doe that willingly and freely, that it rise vp no more against the soule, through concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

For after the soule is separated from the body, and gone out of this life and waie, it can doe no more good.</hi> That is also called a farthing, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and as it were omitted in the considerations of the minde. <hi>Our conscience also, is saide to be our aduersarie: for it doth secretly

Therefore that great and onely God cannot be worshipped, but by the sonne; he that thinkes he worships the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, as he worships not the sonne; so doth he not worship the father: but he that embraceth the sonne, and beares his name; he also
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6236:81"/> with the sonne, worships the father: because the embassador, and messenger, and high priest of the father, is the sonne. Hee is the gate of the great temple, he is the way of light, he is the guide of saluation, he is the doore of lyfe.</hi>

To thinke that they must be requested, as they were, when they liued in the worlde, is to denie this their perfection: and as a thing néedlesse, God neuer teacheth anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession to be made to them.

               <p>And here it perchance maie be obiected, that the fame reason doth take awaie the inuocation of the name of Christ: for hee no doubt praieth for vs, and yet we are commanded to pray to him. I answere, this is commanded in respect of vs, and not in respect of him, he standes in no neede of this our inuocation, or seruice; but we, to declare our duetie to him, and to honour him, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to call on him:<note place="margin">50.15.</note> as the psalme teacheth, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will beare thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> Inuocation here is commanded vs, as a part of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which onelie we are commanded to yeelde him, which wee are not commanded to giue to anie creature besides. Thirdly, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the saintes séemes to sauour of the conclusion of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> which would haue man and wife in heauen: but our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour telleth them plainlie,<note place="margin">Mark. 12. v. 25.</note>

And he confirmes this his saying out of the scripture. And <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as an eie witnesse, sawe the same: and shall not we beleeue al these? Shall we interrupt this their worke, appointed them of God, by our inuocation?

                  </note>
                  <hi>That that was but the saying of a blinde man, that knew not Christ.

Secondlie they obiect, that we maie require the helpe of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in this life, to praie for vs: and therfore also, after this life. But this followeth not, for first, it is one thing to praie or request <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

But they doe not praie the saintes: but praie vnto them, vsing the same phrases and spéeches to them, which they vse to God: and therfore the reason is not all one.</p>
               <p>And first <hi>Augustine</hi> writes thus concerning praier, and defineth it, <hi>that it is a talking with God; when thou readest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. in psal. 85.</note>
                  <hi>God talketh with thee: when thou prayest, thou talkest with God</hi> (saieth he.) <hi>But what? must we despaire of all mankinde, and say that euery man is damned, to whom in his prayers some euill thoughtes creepe in, and interrupts his prayers? If we should saie so, (my brethren) I doe not see, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>pe remaines. And why is there any hope with God? because
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6236:86"/> great is his mercy.</hi> (For he had sayd before) <hi>If any were declaring his cause to a iudge, and would sodainly turne backe, and talke with another man, would he suffer it? And yet God suffereth the heartes of so many that pray vnto him, and yet thinke on diuers thinges in their prayers.</hi> So that, here is the great mercie of God; euen in our best workes, are imperfections: who then dare trust in his workes? Secondlie, we maie learne what praier is, it is a tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God; not with anie saint or Angell. And after, in the same Psalme he speaketh thus of Inuocation: <hi>The wicked</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue not called vpon God: They haue called vpon; but not vpon God. Thou callest vpon, whatsoeuer thou louest; thou callest vppon, whatsoeuer thou callest into thy selfe; thou callest vpon, whatsoeuer thou wouldest haue come vnto thee.</hi> Therefore, if wee will haue no saint come to vs, nor to come into vs; but God alone, he must dwell in vs: we must call vpon God alone, by <hi>S. Agustines</hi> definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>No Angel or sainte can mingle it selfe with our soules, but Gods spirit onely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ser. <hi>3</hi> super Cantica.</note> as <hi>Bernard</hi> saieth.

                  <note place="margin">Confess. Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>and whether it bee better to know thee, or to call vppon thee. But who will call vpon thee, not knowing thee? He may call vpon one for another, that knoweth thee not. Or whether rather, art thou not called vpon, that thou mayest be knowne? And howe shall they call vpon, in whom they haue not beleeued? And how shal they beleeue, without a preacher, &amp;c.</hi> And after. <hi>I will seeke thee, O Lord, calling vpon thee, and I will call vpon thee, beleeuing in thee; for thou hast been preached to vs: my faith O Lord calleth vpon thee, which thou hast giuen me, which thou hast inspired me by the humanitie of thy sonne, by the ministery of thy preacher,</hi> (meaning Iesus Christ) <hi>who hath taught vs in the gospell, to call vpon God the father in his name, and we shall most assuredly obtaine our petitions.</hi> Vpon this promise preached by our sauiour, <hi>Augustine</hi> grounded his faith. And a little after: <hi>And how shall I call vpon my God and my Lord? Because truly, I will call him into my selfe, when I call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And what place is in mee, that my God may come vnto me? &amp;c.</hi> By these places it appeareth, that according to <hi>S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> iudgement, inuocation is a chiefe part of Gods honour, and linked and annexed to faith: and therefore not to bee giuen to anie creature. And in another place he writes thus: <hi>Not euery one
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6236:86"/> that trusteth in his owne strength:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>but he that calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saued. But how shall they call vpon him, in whom they haue not beleeued? To this end therefore they beleeue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a right; that they may call vpon him, on whom they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued; and that they maie be able to do that, which they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in commandement by the lawe. For that which the lawe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, faith obtaineth.</hi> Thus far <hi>Austen.</hi> Here is the right ende of faith, to call on the name of the Lord.

                  </note> and adoration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For he writes thus. <hi>Where one translation hath, they shal worship him alwaies: another hath, they shall pray to him alwaies; as S. Augustine also reads. In which words two thinges are to bee marked, one is, that praier is so acceptable to God, that he accepts it instead of adoration; which is a thing greatly to bee weighed. For one of the greatest seruices, that God requires in the world, is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, with the worship of Latria. And it so delights him, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe gyfts vpon men, and that men should pray vnto him, that hee calles prayer, adoration. The second thing that there is to be noted is, that adoration worship, ought to followe perfect prayer: And therefore that which one translation cals praier, another cals adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Phillippus de dies.</hi> We maie note here, that he is forced to confesse, that praier is the chiefest part of Gods honor, &amp; that praier and adoration must go together. Therefore when they praie to saintes, let Catholiques take héede, least by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they giue <hi>Latria,</hi> euen diuine honour, vnto them.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6236:87"/> O perfect truth: wherein, O thou the same truth, direct and teach me in thy truth. For what is more pleasant, then to call vpon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter, in the name of his onely begotten; then to moue the father to mercy, by the remembrance of his sonne, to mitigate the kings anger, with the naming of his deare childe? So are guilty persons deliuered out of prisons: so they y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are bound, are set free: so they that haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the doleful sentence of death, are not woont only to be absolued; but moreouer to obtaine extraordinary fauour, while they shall vrge to their angrie princes, the loue of their beloued children.</hi> And after: <hi>And what other intercessor, I shall direct to thee, I know not, but him that is the propitiation for our sins, and fitteth at thy right hand, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king request for vs.</hi> And to this exposition agrées <hi>Arnobius.

To him all hidde thinges are manifest, and without his will, nothing can chance vnto you. Settle your mindes daily, in the beholding of him, and loue nothing besides him, because he cares for you.</hi> This was the first Catholique religion, euery daie to thinke on Iesus Christ: to loue nothing besides him: not to doubt of his loue and clemencie; but to beléeue it to be without anie measure.</p>
               <p>But some will saie, I will call to the blessed virgine or to some one saint, that he maie haue a speciall care of mee.

                  </note> Thou seest how forcible the word of God is.

And now because our faith altogether beholdeth that wholy, and marketh nothing with fleshly eies: it perceiueth that not in shape, but in vertue those things are the body of Christ, which are seen. <hi>What can be more plaine then this?

And he addeth, that a like plaister must be applied to this sore. Therfore séeing as the substance of our soule and bodie was not sicke; but the forces and powers thereof; it must needes followe, that he meaneth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that to heale this corruption, not the substance of Christes bodie; but the effectes, vertues, and forces thereof to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Also we maie note here, what he meaneth by flesh in the latter place, euen the same no doubt, which hee meaneth in the former: that is, the force and vertue of Christes flesh, which hee calleth the diuine essence. Which thing also, the worde powreth, seemeth to inferre: but most plainlie that proueth the same, which he addeth.</hi> That we participate the spirit, and that wee are not transubstantiate with Christ, or partaker of his substance, or of his naturall body. For the sonne is onely consubstantiall with his father <hi>(saith he)</hi> neither the substance of the trinitie is to be deuided, or parted.

                  <hi>First, the number of the sacraments,</hi> Saint Paul <hi>here mentions but two; as also before</hi> cap. 10.2. <hi>baptisme, and the Lordes supper: by a figure called Synecdoche, vnder the name of the cuppe.

And after</hi> Cyprian <hi>addeth:</hi> So the church, being made the bodie of Christ, obeyeth her head. And the high light, beeing spread into these inferiour thinges, with the fulnesse of his brightnesse, reacheth from ende to ende; who alone abyding with himselfe, yet hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partes himselfe wholly to all: and the<note n="*" place="margin">Identitas caloris.</note> same heate is so present with the body, that it neuer departeth from the head. <hi>See howe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares

We eate here on earth, vnder a sacrament, the bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the same we shall eate without a sacrament more manifestly in heauen. <hi>What can be plainer then this?

                     </gap> sée what he wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth concerning the vnworthie receiuers of these holy mysteries:</hi> The sacraments <hi>(saieth he)</hi> as much as in them lyeth, cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their proper vertue: Neither by any meanes, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> diuine maiesty absē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it selfe from the mysteries; but although the sacramentes suffer themselues to be touched or receiued, of those which are vnworthie of them: yet they cannot be partakers of the spirit, whose infidelitie or vnworthines gaine saieth such holines. <hi>Here he plainly saith that the spirit is receiued in the sacraments, which the wicked cannot be partakers of. And after:</hi> The master of this tradition had saide, that vnlesse we did eate his body and drinke his bloud, we should not haue lyfe in vs: instructing vs with a spirituall lesson and opening our vnderstanding, to such a hidden matter, that wee might knowe that our abyding in him, was an eating, and drinking were, as it were, a certaine incorporation, our seruices and duties being subiect to him, our willes ioyned, our affections vnited. Therefore the eating of his flesh, is a certaine greedinesse, &amp; a certaine desire of abyding in him, by which we so impresse and drawe into our selues the sweetnesse of charitie, that this sauour of charity powred in, stickes in our mouth, &amp; in our bowels; piercing and refreshing all the inwarde partes of our
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6236:96"/> soules and bodies. Eating &amp; drinking hath the same reason, by which as our bodilie substance is nourished, liueth and remayneth safe and sound: so the lyfe of the spirit is nourished with this proper foode: and that which meate is to the flesh, that is faith to the soule: that which meat is to the body, that is the word to the spirit; doing with more excellent vertue that eternally, which our carnall foode and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do temporally, and but for a time. We celebrating the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are admonished as a beast, parting the hoofe, and chewing the cud; to call backe to our chawes, and to grind small the example of our Lords institution, that his passion should euer be in our memory. Neither the torments of death, should once terrifie or make afraid the heires of him y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> was crucified: but the ioyfull solemnities of the speed▪ resurrection, should feed them, and refresh them. <hi>And after of the communion of this sacrament he writes thus:</hi> Neither the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the Leuiticall dignity, admits onely the priest to the bread of Iesus: all the whole church is inuited to this banquet, an equal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is giuen to all, he is wholy distributed; being distributed, he is not dismembred, he is incorporated, and not iniuried: he is receiued and not included: dwelling with weakelings, he is not weakened: he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines not the ministery of poore men, a pure faith, a sincere minde, delightes this inhabiter. Neither the narrownesse of our poore house offendeth, or pincheth the greatnesse of the almighty God. This bread of Angels, hauing all pleasure in it, by a wonderfull vertue to all that receiue it worthily and deuoutly, tastes euen as he would haue it, &amp;c. <hi>Here we maie plainlie see, that the sacrament was common to all in his daies, as well the cuppe as the bread, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is present at that heauenlie banquet, but he is not included vp in the bread, as they would haue it. That he cals it the bread of Angels, as he did before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But some will obiect; that which followeth in</hi> Cyprian, <hi>where hee speaking of the wicked, (who iudge not themselues, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the sacraments: but vse the holie giftes vnreuerentlie, as common meates) addes;</hi> that Christ euen to this daie, creates that his most true and holy body, and sanctifieth it, and blesseth it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributes it, to the worthy receiuers. <hi>This place maie séeme obscure: but</hi> Cyprian <hi>is all one with himselfe. The doctrine he hath taught before, in this place he retracteth not: as maie bee most plainlie gathered out of another place:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De vnctione Chrismatis.</note> Our Lord gaue in the table, in which he participated the last banquet with his Apostles, with his owne hands
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6236:96"/> bread and wine: but on the crosse, he gaue his body to be wounded, to the handes of the souldiers, that sincere truth, and true sincerity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprinted in his Apostles, he might expound to the nations, how the wine and bread were flesh and bloud, and by what reason the causes agreed with the effectes, and diuers names or shapes might be reduced to one essence, and the things signifying and signified, should be called by the same names. <hi>Here is his former doctrine, that the sacraments are called by the names of the thinges they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, by reason of the effectes. But more plainlie in another place he vnfoldeth this matter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De resurr.</note> The newe thinges and the olde thinges in this agree; Israell comes out of the bondage of Egypt; the people of God, commeth out of the kingdome of the diuell; the Hebrewes were baptized in the cloud and in the sea; the people of God are now cleansed from their sinnes by the holy ghost and the bloud of Christ: of diuers families one house is made, and one tribe; there is one meat; the thinges signifying, and the thinges signified, the thinges and the signes, the inuisible vertue, and the visible sacraments; doe so make one bodie, as the flesh and the spirit. And that which is seene, both in name and vertue, is accounted the body of Christ. <hi>Here we may plainlie sée, what bodie Christ Iesus creates, his bodie in vertue, not his naturall bodie.</hi> That which is seene <hi>(saith</hi> Cyprian) is his bodie: <hi>but howe?</hi> in nature? <hi>no;</hi> but in name and vertue. <hi>This is</hi> Cyprians <hi>doctrine. The sacraments are called by the names of the thinges signified: The vertue, force and graces of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, are called Christes bodie. I would to God the Papists, which so much vrge the fathers, would herein agrée with</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and communicate the Lordes cuppe, to the Lordes people; and let Christes naturall bodie be in heauen, and with</hi> Cyprian <hi>and our church, receiue the vertue and force thereof here on earth.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.45.</note> There is a naturall body, and there is a spirituall body: <hi>and he defineth both these bodies thus:</hi> The first man Adam was made a liuing soule, and the last Adam was made a quickning spirit. <hi>So that this quickning spirit, may seeme to be the spirituall body of the last</hi> Adam; <hi>as the liuing soule, was the naturall bodie of the former</hi> Adam. <hi>And this is that spirituall bodie, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the sacraments from our last</hi> Adam <hi>Iesus Christ: as wee haue receiued our naturall bodies, from our first</hi> Adam <hi>and our naturall parents: And this spirit shall raise vs vp againe, at the last daie. And therfore our bodies also are called temples of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy ghost. Hence also no doubt, because the chiefest properlie of the holie ghost,</hi>

                  <hi>Of the eating of Christes naturall flesh, also thus the fathers haue written. And first</hi> Cyrill <hi>of these words of our sauiour,</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. <hi>writes thus:</hi> Let vs see <hi>(saieth hee)</hi> howe euery man is either cleane or vncleane,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. in. Leu.</note> euery man hath some meate in himselfe, which he may giue to his neighbor, that comes to him: For it cannot be, that when wee men meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and shall intermingle our speeches, but that wee shall take or giue amongst our selues, some tast, either by our answere, or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or some gesture. And if so be that he be a cleane man, and of a good mind, of whom we tast; we receiue cleane meat: but if he be an vncleane man, whom we touch; we receiue vncleane meate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those things which are saide before. And therefore I thinke, the Apostle Paul, of such vncleane men as of beasts, saieth, Eate not with them. But that thou maiest more euidently vnderstand these things, we do say: we wil take an example of the greatest things, that so descending by little and little, wee may come to the inferior. Our Lord and sauiour saith: Vnlesse you eat my flesh, and drinke my bloud, you shall not haue lyfe euerlasting: for my flesh truly is meat, and my bloud truly is drinke. Iesus therefore speaketh, and is altogether cleane, all his flesh is meat, and all his bloud is drinke, because all his workes are holy, and all his speech is true. And therefore his flesh is truly meat, and his bloud truly drinke: For with the flesh and drinke of his word, as with cleane meat and drinke, he makes drinke, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth al mankind. In the second place, after his flesh, Peter and Paul
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6236:99"/> Paul are cleane meat, and all the Apostles. In the third place, all their disciples. And so euerie one of them according to the qualities of their merits, or purenesse of their iudgements, is made cleane meat to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rne away his eares, according to those which said: How will he giue vs his flesh to eat? who can heare him? And they departed from him. But you, if you be sonnes of the church, if endued with the mysteries of the gospell, if the word made flesh, dwell in you; acknowledge what things we say: for they are the Lordes: least peraduenture hee that is ignorant, hereafter be not known. Know you, that they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures which are written in the diuine bookes; and therefore examine them as spirituall, and not as carnall men, and vnderstand what things are ment: For if you receiue these thinges as carnall men, they hurt you: and they feed you not. For not only in the olde testament, but in the gospel also, there is a letter found which killeth: a letter that killeth him, which shall not marke spiritually those thinges which are spoken. For if according to the letter, thou shalt followe this, which is spoken; Vnlesse ye eate my flesh, and drinke my bloud: this letter killeth. Wilt thou that I bring another letter out of the gospel, which killeth? He that hath not <hi>(saieth he)</hi> a sword, let him sel his coate and buy a sword. Behold, this is a letter of the gospell; but it killeth: but if thou vnderstand it spiritually, it killeth thee not. But there is in vs a quickning spirit: and therefore whether in the law, or in the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, take spiritually those thinges which are said. <hi>Wee maie note here, howe</hi> Cyrill <hi>plainly expoundes this sentence of our sauiour, spirituallie: If the Papistes opinion were true, he néeded not so to expound it. He teacheth, that this is the catholique doctrine of the whole church: and therefore he commandes all the sons of the church, to beleeue this his exposition. The flesh and bloud of our sauiour, wherewith he feedes and refresheth all mankinde; hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes plainly, to be his wordes and workes. Naie and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them, that will expound it of his naturall flesh: or else some might haue saide, with his word and workes he féedes, I grant: but doeth hee not also féede with his flesh? But</hi> Cyrill <hi>plainlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the one, and denieth the other. Nay he affirmeth that hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat shall expounde it so, killeth his soule: and hee that will not knowe this his exposition, let him take heede y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he be not knowne hereafter. And he giues an example, least any man should doubt of his meaning, which otherwise, is as plaine as maie bee. This
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6236:100"/> sentence (saith he) is to be expounded, as that wherein our sauiour saith,</hi> Hee that hath no sworde, let him sell his coate, and buy one. <hi>No man nowe is so sencelesse, that will expound this sentence of our sauiour, according to the letter, who in all his doings exhorts to peace and concord, and of whose kingdome</hi> Micah <hi>prophesieth:</hi> That men shall turne their swordes to siethes:<note place="margin">Micah. 3.4.</note>
                  <hi>but spiritually, that euerie man should nowe prepare him spirituall armour: that is,</hi> the sworde of the word of God. <hi>And by the two swords, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles shewed him after,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Luc. ca. 22.</note> Bonauenture <hi>expoundes</hi> the two testaments are meant, in which <hi>(saieth he)</hi> is contained sufficient doctrine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the whole church. <hi>And so also must this other sentence bee expounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Origen <hi>also at large affirmeth the same worde for worde vpon the</hi> 16. <hi>chapter of</hi> Leuiticus, <hi>expounding these wordes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour:</hi> Vnlesse ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man: <hi>so that worde for worde he agrees with</hi> Cyrill. <hi>And he addeth:</hi> If according to this meaning, that is spiritually, we shall say that the omnipotent God hath giuen lawes to men; I thinke that the giuing of the lawe, shall seeme worthy the maiesty of God: But if we shall cleaue to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and shall take those thinges which are written, according to that which seemes to the Iewes, or that which seemes to the common people; I am ashamed to saye that God gaue such lawes. For the lawes of men shall seeme<note n="*" place="margin">Magis elegātes.</note> more fine and reasonable, that is to say, of the Romanes or Athenians or Lacedemonians. But if according to this meaning which the church teacheth, the lawe of God be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">De doctrina chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana lib. <hi>3.</hi> c <hi>15</hi>
                  </note> then it surpasseth all mans lawes; and it shall truely be beleeued to bee the lawe of God, &amp;c. Augustine <hi>also expoundes the same place after the same manner:</hi> Let <hi>(saith he)</hi> in all figuratiue spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, this rule bee obserued, that that which is read, so long be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently considered, till the exposition thereof be brought to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of charity: but if it signifie that properly, then let it be thought to be no figuratiue speech. If it be a commandement, forbidding a wickednesse or haynous Act; or commanding profit or humanity, it is no figuratiue speech: but if it seeme to command a wickednes, or haynous Act, or to forbid profit or humanity: then it is a figuratiue speech. Vnlesse ye shall eate <hi>(saith he)</hi> the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shal not haue life in you: it seemes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a wickednesse or hainous Act. Therefore it is a figure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding vs to communicate, to be partakers of the passion of Christ,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6236:100"/> and profitably and ioyfully to lay vp in our memories, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for vs. The scripture saith: If thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie be hungrie, feede him; if he be thirsty, giue him drinke. <hi>Here no man doubts,</hi> but it commandes mercy: but that which followes, for doing this, thou shalt heape coales of fire vpon his head, thou must suppose to command an Act of ill will: and therefore it is figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vnderstood. Augustine <hi>here saith, that this speech séemes to command an haynous Act, which commands to eat the flesh of the sonne of man, whome he beléeued to be the sonne of God, and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent: yet he did not attribute this eating his flesh, to his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, as nowe the Papistes doe. And he puts this his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment downe, in that booke he makes of christian doctrine. If thou therefore wilt be</hi> Augustines <hi>scholler, thou must beléeue this, that he there teacheth. And he séemes to affirme it to be as haynous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>lence, to eate the verie true and naturall flesh of Christ, as of anie other man: he makes no difference as should seeme. And againe,</hi> Augustine <hi>of Christes naturall bodie, most manifestly writes thus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In psal. 98.</note> The wordes which I haue spoken to you <hi>(saith Christ)</hi> are spirit and life; vnderstand you spiritually that which I haue spoken. For you shall not eate this body which you see, nor drinke that bloud which they shall shed which shall crucifie mee: I haue commended to you a sacrament, which being vnderstood spiritually, shall quicken you. And although it be needfull that it should be celebrated visibly: yet it must be vnderstood inuisibly.</p>
               <p>Athenagoras <hi>also affirmes the same:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De resurrection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> It is impossible <hi>(saieth he)</hi> that mans body should be mingled with bodies of the same kinde, to which they are intruded against nature for meate: although they bee conueied into their bellies, through some very hard calamity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. For they rebound from the nutritiue faculty. It is against nature <hi>(saith he)</hi> that mans flesh should be fed with mans flesh: but if they shall bee forced together, yet the one will rebound from the other. <hi>And hereof</hi> Cyprian <hi>saith,</hi> that we come by reason of the sacrament, to the consubstantiation of Christ, not of his flesh, but of his spirit, <hi>as is before alleaged. What can be more manifestlie spoken then that? Hence is that phrase,</hi> strengthened in the spirit; <hi>And againe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.16. 2.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:6236:101"/> so seldome. Here we maie sée the consent of the Gréeke and Latine Church, concerning this matter: if anie one of these had saide this, it had beene sufficient. And all these expresse their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges so plainlie, as no man, that is not wilfully obstinate, can doubt of their meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hierom <hi>also vpon the Epistle to the</hi> Ephesians <hi>and first chapter, verie excellently writes thus, and agreeth with the rest of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> The flesh and bloud of Christ is two waies to be vnderstood, either that spirituall and diuine flesh, whereof he hath said; My flesh truely is meat, and my bloud truely is drinke; and vnlesse ye eate my flesh and drinke my bloud, ye shall not haue life euerlasting: or else that flesh and bloud, which was crucified and shedde, with the soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers speare. <hi>Here is a plaine distinction of Christes spirituall flesh, and of his naturall flesh. Here</hi> Ierome <hi>plainlie affirmeth, that the flesh we receiue in the sacrament, is a spirituall flesh, and differs from that which was nailed on the crosse. The same distinction hath</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> paed. ca. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> The bloud of Christ <hi>(saith he)</hi> is twofold: The one is carnall, with which we were redeemed from destruction: the other is spirituall, with which wee are annointed; and this is to drinke the bloud of Iesus: to be partaker of the incorruption of the Lorde: <hi>To be holy, to be sanctified. Agréeing herein with that of</hi> S. Paul,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.13.</note> we haue all drunken one spirit. S. Augustine <hi>also hath y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same distinction:</hi> The words I haue spoken to you, are spirit and life.

But if I shall vnderstand that the vertue of the Crosse, is two fould, whereon Christ was hanged in his flesh, and the deuill with his host was triumphed ouer, by the vnderstanding of this sacrament, my soule shall be edified. And that also we may peraduenture high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier amplifie the greatnesse of this mystery; in the tree is vnderstood the knowledge of good and euill, whereon both good Christ and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked sathan was hanged: but the deuill that hee might perish; but the good, that he might liue by his power. As the Apostle saieth of Christ, though he were crucified, through infirmity, yet he liues by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: Yea not onely that he might liue; but that he might make aliue (for he is the last Adam,) with his quickning spirit. But these things are to be vnderstood to bee spoken figuratiuely. For Christ himselfe is called the tree of lyfe. But as in other things, he is shewed to bee the priest, and the sacrifice, and the Altar; and of one vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the other is not hindred, but euery one is meant of him figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely in their places: so now, in the signes of these sacraments, the diuersitie of persons, taken of one and the same, hindereth not. <hi>Wée maie see here, how</hi> Origen <hi>cals Christ the sacrifice, and the priest figuratiuelie. And in another place he writes thus.</hi> Thou which comes to Christ, the true Bishop, which hath made God mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, with his owne bloud, and hath reconciled thee to his father; sticke not in the bloud of the flesh: but learne rather the bloud of the word, &amp; heare him saying to thee, For this is my bloud, which is shed for you, for the remission of your sins.<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>15.</hi> in.

For what auaileth it, to get them mercy, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery tribe is to be considered, by bread of fruite, by workes of fruite? But if they be referred to the great mystery, thou shalt find this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration to haue great force and effect of repropitiation. If thou returnest to that bread that came downe from heauen, and giueth life to this world, that bread of the proposition which God hath set forth, to bee a propitiation through faith in his bloude; and if thou looke to that commemoration, whereof the Lord hath said, Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of mee: thou shalt finde, that this is onelie the remembrance which maketh God mercifull to men. If therefore thou shalt marke more attentiuely the Ecclesiasticall mysteries, in those thinges which the lawe writes; thou shalt finde the image prefigured of the truth to come. <hi>It is not the hearing of masse: but the remembrance of Christs death and passion, which</hi> Origen <hi>giueth such great force to.</hi>

               <p>Epiphanius <hi>also vpon these words of our sauiour,</hi> This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>writes thus:</hi> Therefore all men haue that, that is according to his image,<note place="margin">In. Ancorato.</note> but not according to nature. For men haue not according to the equality of God, that which is after his image. For God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, and cannot be comprehended in the minde, seeing that he is a spirit, and aboue all spirits, and a light aboue all lights. But those things which he hath ordained, these we want not: For hee is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6236:104"/> true, who with grace, bestoweth on man that, that is after his image. And how many are they, which are like? For we see, that our sauiour tooke into his handes, as the gospell witnesseth, that he rose at supper and tooke these, and when he had giuen thanks, he said, This is mine, this and this. And we see, that it is not equal, neither like to the image in the flesh, nor to the inuisible deitie, nor to the line aments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For this is of a round forme, and insensible, as concerning the power. And he would say, by grace this is mine, this and this: And no man, but doth beleeue his words. For hee that beleeueth him not to be true (as he hath said) he falleth from grace and saluation. But that which we haue heard, we beleeue to be his; we know our Lord to be all sense, to be all ful of feeling, to be all good, to be all working, to be all light, to be all incomprehensible. But who hath giuen vs all this, with grace. Epiphanius <hi>goeth about to proue in this place, that man is made according to the image of God: but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proper nature of the diuinitie, but according to grace. And he taketh a similitude from the Eucharist, which hee denies to be the bodie of Christ, according to the true nature of a bodie, when as it hath not the forme of a true bodie, and it lackes sense and moouing: and yet by grace it is truely beléeued to bee his bodie.</hi>

                  </note> giuing more then receiuing, bestowing rather then lacking, lightening them and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them forcible, for a figure of those thinges which should bee wrought in them: that they which beleeue in him in truth, and haue the faith of the truth, might learne that he was made true man, that he was truely baptized, and so also they comming to baptisme, by his ascending vp, might receiue the force of his light: That here, the saying of the Prophet might be fulfilled, Into the change of power, into the giuing of saluation (that is to say) of the power of the bread, taken from Ierusalem, and the strength of the water. So that here in Christ, the power of the bread is made strong, and strength of the water: that the bread should not be our strength; but the vertue of the bread. And truely the bread is meat: but the vertue in it profits to quicken vs; and not that the water alone should cleanse vs, but that in the strength of the water, by faith and force and hope and the perfection of the mysteries, and the calling of the sanctification of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, it should be to vs perfect saluation. <hi>This place makes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6236:105"/> more plaine: There he called the bread of the Eucharist the bodie of Christ by grace; here he giueth vertue to the bread, as in baptisme strength to the water: making equall together those two sacramentes, often repeating this worde,</hi> vertue <hi>or</hi> force, <hi>as the thing of the sacrament, which wee receiue with the bread and cuppe; saying, that this vertue and strength doeth sanctifie vs. The bread (saith he) is meate, but the vertue thereof, profits to quicken vs: alluding no doubt, to that which our sauiour saide,</hi> the flesh profits not, the spirit quickneth. <hi>And this force of the bread, and strength of the water to sanctifie vs; he declares to bee done by grace; and not that in one worde onelie, but in manie wordes, more fullie and plainly expressing it: saying, these thinges to bee done through faith, and hope, and the perfection of the mysteries, and the calling of sanctification; to the perfection of our saluation. The same doctrine worde for worde, the same Author repeates in his booke called</hi> Anacephaleosis.<note place="margin">Pag. 560.</note>. <hi>So that this doctrine did not séeme to slippe from him vnawares; but to be his resolute opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and in those daies, the Catholique and receiued opinion of the whole church.</hi>

                  <hi>Of the omnipotencie of God, which the Papistes vrge so much,</hi> Augustine <hi>also writes thus in his sixt Epistle: where he proue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that the substance of God, cannot bee seene with mortall eies of the saintes in heauen.</hi> God is a spirit <hi>(saieth he)</hi> and therefore they which worship God, must worship him in spirite and truth. If they must thus worship him, then much more, see him. For who dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the substance of God is seene corporally? when as he wil not haue it worshipped corporally. But they doe seeme to say sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, and by asking a question, to vrge the matter more forcibly: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could Christ performe that to his flesh, that with his bodily eies, he might see his father or no? So that if we shall answere: here, hee could not; they will crie out against vs, and say, that wee derogate from the omnipotencie of God. And if we shall grant that he could doe it, they wil conclude their argument of our answere. How much more doe they erre, which doe affirme the flesh of Iesus Christ to be turned into the substance of God, and to be that which God is; that so by that meanes, they may make it fitte to see God, being not so greatly vnlike with any diuersity. I beleeue they will banish this, both from their faith, and perchance also from their eares. And yet notwithstanding, if by a question they were vrged, of these whether
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6236:105"/> God could do this, or he could not? whether did they detract from his power, if they said, he could not? Or will they confesse, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> this shal see none corporally, if they say he can. Therefore as they haue crept out of another mans grinne: so let them creepe out of their own. <hi>Sée here plainlie, howe</hi> Augustine, <hi>in some respectes, to take from the omnipotencie of God some thinges, thinks to be no sinne.

To whom truely, meaning his humane nature, he hath giuen immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, hee hath not taken the nature of it away. According to this shape, he is not thought to be euery where: let vs beware, least we so confirme his diuinity, that wee take not away the truth of his bodie. And it followeth not; that whatsoeuer is in God, should be in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as God is: For of vs the scripture saith truely, that in him we liue, moue and haue our being: yet we are not in euery place, as he is. But that man is otherwise in God; because also God is otherwise in man, after a proper and singular manner. For one person is both God and man, and both is one Iesus Christ, who is in all places in as much as he is God; but in heauen, in as much as he is man. <hi>By these words we maie plainlie sée, that</hi> S. Augustine <hi>beléeued Christs body euen nowe in heauen to be a true bodie. And againe, that Christs body in heauen is nowe also a true bodie, he writes thus:</hi> Take the space from the bodies, and they shall be no where: and because they be no where, they shall not be at all. And take away bodies from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of bodies: and there shall not be a place where they shall bee; and therefore they shall not be at all. S.

Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine <hi>séemeth here plainlie to affirme, that the bread and wine is blessed and sanctified, and then is broken to be deuided. Hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention of transubstantiation. And that all this is done, by praier and request from God, and not by the power of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> priest, as nowe is taught.</hi>

Neither verely doth he lye, that being asked, saieth, hee is sacrificed: For if the sacramentes had not a certaine simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of those thinges, whereof they are sacraments, they were no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments at all. And of this similitude, for the most parte also, they take the names of the thinges. Euen as therefore, after a certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the sacrament of the body of Christ, is the body of Christ, the sacrament of the bloud of Christ, is the bloude of Christ: so the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith, (meaning baptisme) is faith. For to beleeue is nothing else, then to haue faith. And by this when as it is answered, that the Infant beleeueth, when as yet it hath not the affection of faith: yet it is answered, he hath faith, because he hath the sacrament of faith, that is, baptisme: and it is said to turne to God, for the sacrament of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, because also the answeare pertaineth to the celebration of the sacrament; as of baptisme it selfe <hi>(the Apostle saieth)</hi> wee are buryed together with Christ, by baptisme to death: he doth not say, we signifie buriall; but he plainly saith, we are buried. The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore, of so greate a matter, he did call by the name of the same thing. <hi>Here we maie plainelie sée, what</hi> S. Augustine <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in other places, when he saieth, Christ is offered at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: that is, he is not offered in himselfe, as he is very flesh, body, and bloud; as now is taught in the Romaine church: but in a sacrament, that is, in a holie signe; for so he declareth the word sacrament what it meaneth, in his fift Epistle.</hi> It were ouerlong <hi>(saieth he)</hi> to dispute conuenientlie of the diuersitie of signes: when as they belong to diuine things, they are called sacraments. So that a Sacrament is a signe applied to some diuine matter: and by such a sacrament or holie signe, is Christ offered in the church, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords supper. <hi>And againe, he teacheth,</hi> that sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue but a similitude of those things, whereof they are sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: they are not the things themselues. And of this similitude, for the most part, they take the names of the things themselues. <hi>Here
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:6236:107"/> all men maie sée plainlie, the reason why</hi> Augustine <hi>calleth the bread in the supper of the Lorde, the body of Christ: because it is like the bodie of Christ, being giuen and broken for our sakes. They take their names of the similitude (saieth he) and not of the essence of the thinges. So saith he,</hi> after a certaine manner the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the body of Christ, is the body of Christ: so the sacrament of faith (that is baptisme) is faith. <hi>And marke here, howe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the sacraments together; that as the bread is the bodie of Christ, after a certaine manner: so baptisme, is also faith: he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no difference of the one, more then of the other: The bread is no more the bodie of Christ, then baptisme is faith. For he saieth plainlie, as the bread is the bodie of Christ: so baptisme is faith. Then by his iudgment, as there is no trāsubstantiation in the one: so no more is there in the other.</hi>

                  <hi>An offence was taken, as should séeme, in</hi> Augustines <hi>daies, both in the ouer much reuerence done to the Martyres, and of the vehement spéeches of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Fathers also, concerning the sacrament: as appeareth by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Epistle of</hi> Maximus Meganrensis <hi>the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to</hi> S.

And so as much as in them lieth, they which barre the people from receiuing it, would put them out of the league; and themselues be only, as they call themselues, the Lords Cleargie or inheritance. For so the worde <hi>Cleargy</hi> signifieth. And here their <hi>(concornitantia)</hi> falleth to the grounde. For if that woulde haue serued the turne, what néeded Christ to haue ordeined the cup, either for minister or people? For he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> receiueth the bodie, be he priest or people: receiueth by a necessarie consequent, (as they saie,) the bloud too. But Christ did ordaine nothing in vaine: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must beleeue it was ordeined, as well for the people, as for the pastor.

And therfore <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>Should not a people aske counsell of their God, for the liuing?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay 8.19.</note>
                  <hi>shal they aske counsell of the dead? To the lawe and testimony get you, sticke to them. If they shall not answere according to that worde: to such there is no morning, no light.</hi> They are deuils, they are of the prince of darkenesse. And to this <hi>S Paul</hi> agrees,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note>
                  <hi>If an angell from heauen, preach another gospell,</hi> in bringing vs anie other newes, or anie gladde tydinges of our saluation, <hi>then that yee haue already receiued, let him bee accursed: yea or wee our selues,</hi> which are the Apostles of Christ, yea or the church. The gospel is to be beléeued, before angels, before all the Apostles; and therefore
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6236:113"/> before the church. Let vs beware therefore, least the appearance of angels, the name of the church, beguile vs. For vnder such craftie meanes, and bare names, and outward shewes, shall these false teachers créepe in. And therefore the Apostles haue told vs, of their craftie créeping in: and also of their meanes which they should vse; that we being thus warned, might not bee beguiled. And of these their craftie meanes, <hi>S. Paul</hi> in another place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth all christians:<note place="margin">1. Ti. 4.1.</note>
                  <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>the spirit speaketh euidently, that in the latter times, some shal reuolt frō the true faith, that which they haue receiued,</hi> (for so the Gréeke word signifieth) <hi>and shal giue heede to spirites of error, and to the doctrines of diuels.</hi> Here is a plaine prophesie of the spirit of God, that some shall reuolte from the faith: and how shall they be seduced? they shall not giue héede to the worde of God: but to spirits, and reuelations: which shall teach them errors no doubt, vnder the shape of angels: they shall teach them the doctrines of diuels, as the Apostle teacheth vs here, <hi>Forbidding to marry, and to abstaine from meats:</hi> not condemning marriage, but forbidding it to some; as also some kinde of meats. Beware therefore of reuelations of spirites or angels; least you learne the doctrines of deuils. The Apostle teacheth vs here, that by such meanes manie shall bee deceiued. Their prohibition of marriage to their priestes, and of meats, at certaine times to all men, for religion, and holinesse and deuotion, who knoweth not? And these two pointes declare, that they are they, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speakes of. And the Apostle putteth downe these two as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall or chiefe pointes; whereby they shall winne credit with the worlde: as they haue done, by their Carthusians or charter house Monkes, who neuer did eate flesh; and by their other Monkes and Friers, who neuer married: Not denying, but that they shall teach other doctrines also. For their doctrine of purgatory, and of praying for the dead, and of Masses, and of dirges, and of inuocations of saintes; by these visions &amp; apparitions, no doubt of diuels, vnder the shape of saintes and men departed, haue bene confirmed. For in their legendes they haue a vision, to prooue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of these. Sathan dare not come in his owne likenesse: for then all men would flie from him. Hee dare not come when men are awake, for then they would some of them bewraie him; he dare not sow Henbaine or poison, for then no man would reape it▪ but he commeth like an angel, he comes when men are a sléepe,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6236:113"/> and doe giue small héede to him, when they are otherwise occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either in wars or in other earnest affaires, and soweth tares: and thus he craftelie creepeth into the house of God, into the harts of Gods people. But Gods worde, is the onelie light to discerne him by.</p>

                  <hi>and with what bodies</hi> (saieth <hi>Augustine) these and such like curiosities are determined with perill: seeing there is no fault in not knowing them. But wee haue more neede to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and iudge, when Sathan transformes himselfe into an angell of light, least by beguiling vs, he seduce vs into some hurtfull things. For when he beguiles the sense of the bodie, but moues not the minde, from the true and right assurance, by which euery man leades a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life, there is no danger in religion: or when he faining himselfe to be good, doth or speakes those thinges, which belonges to good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, though he bee accounted good, it is no error hurtfull or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to christian religion. But when as, by these properties of good angels, he beginnes to drawe vs to his owne things, then to discerne him and not to follow him, there is neede of great watchfulnesse. But howe is it possible that any man should escape his deadly deceits, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God guide him, and defend him? And this difficulty is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to this ende; least any man should be a hope to himselfe, or any man to another; but God to all his. For that this thing is most profitable for vs, no godly man doubts. Augustine</hi> here confesseth, that sathan maie take vpon him all the partes of good angels, and maie by them drawe vs, to his doctrine. And that all the fathers or men in the world, are not able to discerne these his deceiptes, but God alone: he is so cunning and so subtill. It is to be feared for lacke of the light of Gods worde, which was extinguished and put as it were vnder a bushell in the time of our forefathers, that he beguiled manie.</p>
               <p>Of this crafty créeping in of Antichrist,<note place="margin">Io. 8.45. 2.

Lying apparitions, lying intrusions of books vnder the name of saintes, corruptions of writers and fathers: And therefore <hi>S.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6236:114"/> signing of the Apostle, if he had not feared some forgerie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it fell out indeede. For thus I read in <hi>Cyrill, I finde in a certaine booke</hi> (saieth he) <hi>sayd of the Apostles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10. in. Leu.</note>
                  <hi>blessed is he that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth to this end, that he may feede the poore.</hi> This booke which <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> here makes mention of, is not canonicall, and therefore craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily thrust into the church, of sathan: As also was <hi>Peters</hi> gospell, whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> makes mention. <hi>That booke</hi> (saieth he) <hi>which is called the Acts of Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. hist. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note>
                  <hi>and that is called the gospell after his name, yea and that is called his preaching, or a reuelation: is not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted among the canonicall Scriptures.</hi> Here wee may sée sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans craft, how he turnes himselfe into Angelles of light, what goodlie titles he giueth here to <hi>Peters</hi> gospell, <hi>A reuelation from heauen, his Actes, that which hee preached:</hi> and yet all this was but counterfeit, it was but sathans copper, it was none of the gold of Iesus Christ. This one thing were enough to make all men take heede of sathan, how they beléeue euery thing that they shall reade in the fathers, in euerie booke that goeth vnder their names. If he were so bolde, as to counterfeit the Apostles wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: do we thinke, that he will not be more bold, to forge and corrupt the writinges of the fathers and men? And this also is to too manifest. <hi>Augustine</hi> writes that some thought euen in his daies, vnder <hi>Cyprians</hi> name, bookes were counterfeited: <hi>Some thinke</hi> (saieth <hi>Augustine) that Cyprian neuer held this opinion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization,</hi>

                  <hi>but it was counterfeited of bold and lying persons, vnder his name. For</hi> (saieth he) <hi>the sinceritie and integrity of the writings of any, although he were neuer so sound a Bishop, could be so kept, as the holie canonicall Scriptures are kept, in so many languages, in such an order and succession of the ecclesiastical celebrations. Against which notwithstanding, there haue not wanted some, who haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged manie thinges, vnder the names of the Apostles.</hi> Wee maie note here, howe <hi>Augustine</hi> in his time confessed, that <hi>Cyprians</hi> workes might be forged; as the scriptures had manie bookes thrust into the church, vnder the name of scriptures, which were not the scriptures: And do we thinke that sathan hath béene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sléepe since this time? no doubt he hath forged <hi>Augustines</hi> workes, and all the fathers in some part, to maintaine his kingdome. And he that would forge whole bookes to confirme his opinion withall; no doubt would not sticke to thrust in sentences: As euen in that 40. Meditation of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that same imperfect sentence may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6236:114"/> séeme to argue a corruption. <hi>I desire of thee, ô Lord,</hi> (saieth hee) <hi>pardon of all my sinnes, from whome and by whome: Let mee haue mercy in the day of necessitie and extremitie.</hi> Here no doubt Christ is left out, from whom and by whom <hi>Augustine</hi> hoped for propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> day of his extremity.

In his oration in the praise of <hi>Constantine,</hi> he saieth, <hi>That in all places through the worlde churches were erected to the onelie God;</hi> Agréeing with <hi>Augustine,</hi> who long after his daies, wrote that euen <hi>then they builded no churches to martyrs.</hi> And yet for all this, <hi>Lib. 4. de vita Constantini,</hi> he makes mention of the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the temple of martyrs.

               <p>And behold here another subtiltie of sathan, if this his former practise will not take place, he will endeuour to take the worde of God quite from the faithfull, and to cast mists and darkenesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes.

This serpent cannot abide the right eie of Gods people, that is, that they should knowe the right seruice of God, according to his worde. And such a like league hath the Pope made with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church of God in our daies. It was lawfull for them to doe what they would, so they knew not the scriptures.

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> agréeing with the gospell, thus paints out these false christians: <hi>Thus faith the Lord</hi> (saieth he) <hi>feede the sheepe of slaughter:</hi>

                  <hi>for they which possesse them, slaye them, and thinke they sin not, and they that sell them, say, blessed be the Lord, for I am rich: and their owne sheepheardes spare them not. And therefore saith the Lord, I will no more spare the inhabitantes of the land: and I fed the sheepe of slaughter; euen the poore of the earth. And I tooke to me two staues, the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bondes: and I fedde the sheepe.</hi> Here the Prophet plainly paintes out the couetous, carelesse, and cruell scribes and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and the louing, painfull, &amp; amiable sheepheard Iesus Christ. <hi>And I cut off three sheepheardes in one moneth,</hi> that is, in a shorte time, that is those wicked pastors, <hi>Scribes, Pharises, and Lawyers.

And they knewe surely, those poore sheepe that wayted on me, that it was the worde of the Lord. And I saide to them, if it seeme good in your eies, giue mee my wages; and if no, leaue of. And they waied for my wages, thirty peeces of siluer. And the Lord saide to me, cast it vnto the potter. A goodly price, that I was valewed at of them. And I tooke the thirty peeces of siluer, and cast them into the house of the Lord, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the potter. Then I brake my other staffe, euen bandes: that I might dissolue the bandes between Iudah and Israell, that they might nowe no more be accompted brethren:</hi> But that by the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles, a new brotherhood might be begun, through the whole worlde.

But for all this, they sette before our eyes, a wonderfull state of their common wealth. They dwell in their owne countries; but as it were strangers: They haue al things common with other men, as it were Citizens; and yet they patiently suffer all thinges, as though they were strangers. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery strange region is their countrie, and euery country is as it were a strange region to them. They marry wiues, as all other men do, and beget children, but they cast not forth their children: They haue a common table, but not defiled: They are in the flesh, but they liue not after the flesh: They liue on earth; but they haue their common wealth in heauen: They obey lawes which are enacted of princes; but in the manner of their lyfe, they far exceede all lawes: They loue all men, and all men persecute them: They are not known, and yet they are condemned: They are killed, and yet they are reuiued: They are poore, &amp; yet they make many rich: They lacke al things, &amp; yet they abound in all things. <hi>And after:</hi> that I may comprehend all things in a word, that which the soule is in the body, christians are in the world.

And these were the causes that made so manie liue in chastitie in those daies. And of this voluntarie cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie and liuing solitarie, thus wee reade of</hi> Augustine <hi>himselfe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Possidanius in vita Aug.</note> being nowe baptized of Ambrose, and being turned to God, from the inward bowels of his heart, he forsooke all the hope he had in the world; seeking not nowe a wife, nor sonnes, after the flesh, nor riches not honours of this world; but he determined to serue God, with all his; studying to bee in that, and of that little flocke, whome the Lord speakes vnto saying, Feare not little flocke, it hath pleased your father to giue you a kingdome. Sell that you haue, and giue almes, and make you bagges, that shall neuer waxe olde, and treasure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sayling in heauen, &amp;c. <hi>And after:</hi> And then, being aboue thirty yeares olde, his mother being aliue onely, called Monica, and liuing with him; reioyced more of his purpose taken vpon him of seruing God, then of children after the flesh. <hi>Here we maie sée a holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, of not marrying, of seruing God, of forsaking the worlde:

                  </gap> his heart, that he will keepe his virgine: and not giue her to marriage, doth well. <hi>Here the father, knowing his daughters strength, may fully purpose in his mind, not to giue his daughter in marriage, but to keepe her a virgine: here is no vowe, but a purpose of the father. So may, no doubt, euerie man, weying his own strength, purpose in his heart to liue vnmarried, if he will, without anie vowe. And of this holie purpose we read after in</hi> Possidonius, <hi>of</hi> S. Augustines <hi>kinsfolkes, who were no priestes, thus:</hi> Neither dealt he with his kinsfolkes, either placed in this purpose, or without it, in his life time, after the manner of the common people. To whome whilest he was aliue, he bestowed that in almes (if neede were) which he bestowed on others, but not to make them rich, but that they should either not want, or lesse want. <hi>He did not enrich his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, neither in his life, nor at his death: but if they stood in need, he reléeued them, that they should lesse néede. And some of these also were in this holie purpose, as should séeme, voluntarilie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his counsell and steppes, and some were not. And</hi> S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine <hi>himselfe, counting it a degrée of perfection in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not to seeke after the riches of the worlde, thus writes of this his purpose:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. 89.</note> I which writ these thinges, haue loued that perfection, of the which the Lord spake to the young man; Go and sell all that thou hast. And I haue not done this by my owne strength: but by his grace. And how farre I haue gone forward, in the way of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I know more my selfe, then any other: but God more then I. And to this purpose, with all my might, I exhort others; and in the name of the Lord, I haue companions, to whom this is persuaded by my ministery: so that especially▪ wholsome doctrine may bee kept; neither that we should iudge those with vaine contumacie, which do not these thinges. <hi>This was a voluntarie purpose of</hi> Augustine,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:6236:122"/>
                  <hi>and no vow.</hi> Arnobius <hi>of this purpose also writes thus:</hi>

Insomuch also my master and Lord Iesus Christ allowed the lawfull and chast bed of wedlocke, to those that will marrie in the holinesse and honor of chastifie, that being bidden to certaine mariages, hee sanctified them, with the presence of his maiestie, and made them glad or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with a most wondrous and strange miracle, &amp;c. <hi>But after, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of widowhood and virginitie, hee addes this:</hi> But beyonde these degrees, lawfully granted to man, he both placed widowhood, in a greater reward, and he hath shewed the third excellent steppe of virginity, being perfect, and like to the worthinesse of Angels, to the which the Lord hath inuited vs, saying, All men are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this word; but he that can comprehend it, let him compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it. <hi>As in pretious stones, there are degrees of excellencies; yea and almost in all thinges, so in vertues; so in states of life: But our sauiour bindes none to anie.

                  <hi>as appeareth by</hi> Polidor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, <hi>who writes thus of</hi> Edgar. He chose to be of his counsell lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, holy and godly men, and he made such Bishoppes ouer Christes people. Amongst whom he loued especially (next after Dunstan) Ethelwood &amp; Oswald. The king gaue so much credit to the learning &amp; holines of these three, wherof they made great shewes <hi>(as monks know how to do such a like thing very cunninglie sometime)</hi> that partly, he being moued with their request, and partly being moued, because he sawe that the chiefe priestes kept their wiues, contrary to that, the fathers had a little before decreed: that hee intreated with many requests, Iohn the fifteene Bishop of Rome, that for good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which the Monkes had found out would be for their commodity, that he would grant, that it might be lawfull for them, by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: to expell out of the Colledges of Worcester and Winchester,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:6236:126"/> those priests, which they called secular Canons, and to bring to their places his Monkes, which he obtained. <hi>Here we maie plainlie sée, that the priestes here in England had wiues, and that they had Colledges at Worcester, and at Winchester. And that by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée of the church a little before, it was decreed, that they shoulde haue no wiues. But the ende of this historie, makes the matter more plaine:</hi> The priestes, being thus expelled by the Monkes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to pleade their cause, why they should bee expelled. The matter is brought before the iudges, who when they heard the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at Winchester, in a parlour of the Monkes, in a great assembly; and that the greater part had decreed, that the priestes were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their former honours againe: Beholde sodainly this voice was heard: (They thinke not well which fauour the priests:) as though the lawe made more for the Monkes, which had violently taken away other mens goods, then for the priests, which demanded their owne. But because the Image of Christ, which stood before them, seemed to giue the voice, they all gaue credit to the Oracle: so that the priests were ouercome, and the tumult was ceased. And so the Monkes, by Gods helpe or by mans rather (for euen then there were some, that thought it was the Oracle of Sathan rather then of God; and that it was vttered by mans pollicy, and not by Gods power) kept as wel as might be, the thinges they had gotten. <hi>So by this forged Oracle, the priestes in England lost both their goods and their wiues. In Ireland also the Bishops and priests had wiues, in the beginning of the church. For thus we reade of</hi> Celsus Armachanus <hi>an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Ireland:</hi> And Celsus had wife and children, euen being a Bishop, as it was the custome among the Irish men, till that age. For they had beene Bishops by succession of inheritance fifteene genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with spirituall supremacie of that countrey, and eight of them had beene very well learned.

For I thinke, if any man of the whole world would desire to haue a good wife, he could not finde a better and more conuenient, then hee had. For the excellencies of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of all men and women, in these two mette together: so that, that mariage was not so much a coupling together of bodies, as of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For although they excelled others; yet betweene themselues, in the equality of their vertues, they could not one go beyonde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Surely shee that was giuen to Adam, that shee might be a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him, seeing that it was not good that man should be alone, for an helper became an enemy, and was not a bedfellowe, but an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, stealing awaie her husband through pleasure, and through the signe of knowledge, banishing him from the tree of life: but to my father, she was not onely giuen an helper (for that was lesse to be wondred at) but shee was a guide to him, which by her selfe did drawe him to euerie excellent verue, both by her wordes and workes. <hi>Bishoppes and ministers were maried in those daies, as plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeareth by this narration.

               <head>Of Fasting and abstinence.</head>
               <p>FAsting and abstinence from meats in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beginning was vsed as a meanes to tame the flesh, (as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostle saith.) Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which <hi>Cyrill</hi> puts down his opinion, &amp; the opinion of the catholique church in his daies, thus, most euidently:<note place="margin">In Leu. lib. 10.</note>
                  <hi>How (saith he) after you haue knowne the truth, are you turned againe to the weake and beggerly elements of this world, which as from the beginning, ye will obserue againe? You obserue daies and monethes and times, and yeares. See how by his Prophet Esay, the Lord refused this kind of fasting: and saith, I haue not chosen this fast, saith the Lord, for a day that a man should humble his soule. Thou if thou wilt fast, and humble thy soule, according to Iesus Christ; the time of the whole yeare is open vnto thee: yea haue thou the daies of thy whole life, to humble thy soule in, if so be that, thou hast learned of our Lorde and sauiour, which is meeke and lowly of heart. Thou therefore if thou wilt fast, fast according to the commandement of the gospel, obserue in thy fasting, the lawes of the gospell. In which after this manner our Sauiour commandes, concerning fasting: But thou when thou fastest, annoint thy head, and wash thy face. If thou aske how thou shalt wash thy face: Paul the Apostle teacheth, how thou maiest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the glory of the Lord, his face being reueiled vnto thee, being fashioned againe according to the same Image, from glorie to glory, as though by the spirit of the Lord. Annoint thine head: but beware least with the oile of sinne. Let not the oile of sinne make thy head fat: but annoint thy head, with the oile of ioyfulnesse, with the oile of mirth, with the oile of mercie. So that according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the wise man, mercy and truth depart not from thee.</hi> So that, when we fast, to wash our face, by <hi>Cyrilles</hi> iudgment, is to meditate in the scriptures, by which we are reformed againe, to the glorious Image of God. O happie meditation and reading! which reneweth in thy soule, by little and little, the Image of God, which thou hadst lost by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: Euen as they which walke in the sunne, their bodilie faces are by little and little sunne burnt; so they, which vse reading of the scriptures, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faces of their soules, by little and little, are sunne burned and tanned with the glorie of the Image of God. Againe, to annoint thy head with oile, is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6236:129"/> to fast ioifullie,<note place="margin">To giue almes is to annoint our head when we fast.</note> and not against thy will; and to giue almes, is the oile of mercy, when thou fastest. And after: <hi>Wilt thou that I shal shewe thee how thou shalt fast? fast from all sinne, eate no meate of malice, eate none of the dainties of pleasure, bee not inflamed with the wine of ryot, fast from euill workes, absteine from euill speeches, bridle thy selfe from naughty thoughts, touch not the stolne bread of frowarde doctrine, long not for the deceiptfull meates of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which may seduce thee from trueth. Such a fasting pleaseth God. But to abstaine from meates, which God hath created to bee receiued of the faithfull, with thanksgiuing, and to do this with them that crucified Christ, cannot bee acceptable to God. The Pharisies sometime disdained against the Lord because his disciples fasted not. To whom hee answered, because the children of the bridegroome cannot fast, as long as the bridegroome is with them. They therefore fast, that haue lost their bridegroom: we which haue the bridegroom with vs cannot fast. Neither notwithstanding doe wee say this, that we should loose the bridle of christian abstinence: For we haue the daies of Lent consecrated to fasting, we haue the fourth and sixt day of the weeke, in which we fast solemnly. There is a liberty granted to a christian, to fast at all times, not for the superstition of keeping the fast: but for the vertue of abstinence. For how else could chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vncorrupt be kept among them? vnlesse she were vnderpropped with the pinching staies and props of continency. How shall they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselues to the scriptures? How shal they employ themselues to wisdom and knowledge, but by bridling the belly &amp; abstinence? How shall one geld himselfe for the kingdome of heauen? vnlesse he cut off abundance of meates, vnlesse hee vse abstinency, as a seruant. This therefore is the maner of christian fasting.</hi> Heere wee may see plainelie, that those daies of fasting were obserued in <hi>Cyrils</hi> age, which our church vseth, and the same endes of fasting: that is, not for superstition, as though there were any holinesse in meates, but for continencie and chastitie, to tame the bodie, to bee more apt to study the scriptures: These were the endes for which christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fasted. <hi>But there is also</hi> (saith he) <hi>another kinde of religious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, whose praise is set forth in the writings of some of the Apostles. For we find written in a certaine booke of the Apostles: <hi>Blessed is hee that fasteth, that he may sustaine the poore.</hi> This mans fast is verie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Lord. And indeed worthely enough; for he imitates him that gaue his life for his brethren, &amp;c.</hi> The which kinde of fast
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6236:129"/> also our gracious prince hath commanded of late, and our church hath practised.</p>
               <p>The same ende of fasting we may reade in those which they call the Apostles Canons, <hi>If any Bishop, priest,</hi>

But both these since haue béene accompted steps to heauen, meanes of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And mariage in a minister; as also meates eaten at times, not by the pope prescribed, is abhominable. <hi>Ferus</hi> of this supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meates writes thus: <hi>So many amongst vs,</hi>

They had in those daies mirth enough, but fleshly, wanton, and carnall mirth. What shall wee accompte (to beginne first euen with their best things,) of their senselesse songs without all vnderstanding, of their curious deskants, of their sweete censing, of their costly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, of their statelie processions, where euerie man must keepe his place?

And here note that the Apostle <hi>S.

Do they not plainlie agree, with those whom <hi>Saint Jude</hi> speaketh of: <hi>Who shall deny Christ to bee their onely master, the ruler or gouernour of his house, which is the Church?</hi> So that then Iesus Christ is the onelie head of his church, the onelie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his familie himselfe: Hee giueth this honour to no other. And to denie this, is heresie: it is not christian religion, it is not the catholique faith. And this prerogatiue here spoken of, <hi>S.

Againe the metaphor, which the Apostle vseth, conuinceth the same; he calleth Christ the head, and the church his bodie: Nowe it is monstrous, that one bodie should haue two heads; wherefore in this verie point, the summe and meaning of this metaphor consisteth. Againe in his second chapter,<note place="margin">Verse. 20</note> he calleth him the <hi>head corner stone,</hi> which is but one in euerie building.<note place="margin">Verse 29 Io. 3, 29</note> And in his fourth chapter, <hi>the husband of his church,</hi> which also (as all men knowe) argueth, that hee is the onlie husband, and can abide no companion with him. And in his epistle to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb, 3.5.</note> he compareth him with <hi>Moses: That as Moses was in the house of God as a seruant; so now Iesus Christ is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

If anie man would but a little heere marke, hee shoulde see two euident signes, and tokens of Gods true church and house, which are these. <hi>But Christ as the sonne is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his house: whose house wee are (saith the Apostle) if so be, wee keepe sure or firme our confidence, and the reioicing of our hope, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende.</hi> Here is first the heade and master of the house, <hi>Iesus Christ; 2.</hi> then the house it self <hi>(we)</hi> that is Gods people: then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the conditions, <hi>If wee keepe that confidence and assurance: and that reioicing of our hope, firme and sure vnto the ende.</hi> Marke well these conditions of Gods church.

Because the time shall come, that manie shall saie, they are of the catholique church: If they be, here be the markes they must be knowne by. If they lacke these markes, they are no doubt, none of Gods house: but of sathans sinagogue. These are the vndoubted markes and bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which God himselfe hath giuen to his house. But you will saie, what is that confidence, and that reioicing?

                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn, 5.14</note>

Secondlie they teach vs to doubt, whether wee haue our praiers wee aske of him or not; as when we pray for remission of our sinnes. Nay they teach to praie, but in latine: So that he that praieth, knoweth not himselfe, what he asketh; and therefore cannot be assured whether he haue his petitious or not.

For that the whole worlde hath decreed, and the Councell hath excommunicated him.</hi> And when as <hi>Liberius</hi> had replied, that the <hi>Ecclesiasticall iudgments should be executed with great iustice; and that an excommunication should be had, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius himselfe being called before him: The Emperour still vrgeth, the whole world hath condemned his wickednesse.</hi> And after hee saith to him: <hi>Quota pars es tu totius orbis? <hi>that is, who are you, in comparison of the whole world? or what chiefe man in the world are you? that you alone should maintaine a most wicked man, and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest dissolue the peace of the church?

Let your holinesse also, as it becommeth you, repell the wicked appellations of priestes and cleargie men, which hereafter shall chance: because by no decree of the fathers, this is derogated from the church of Aphrica, and the canons of Nice haue committed most manifestlie, both the clergy men of the lower degrees, and also the bishops, to their Metropolitanes. They haue most wisely, and iustlie foreseene: that all matters should bee ended in those places, where they began. Neither that the grace of the holy spirit should be wanting to any prouince; by which, equity may be both wiselie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and constantly maintained of all Christes priestes; especially seeing it is granted to euerie one, if hee bee grieued with the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, that shall knowe his cause, to appeale either to the councell of his owne prouince, or to a general councell: Vnlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance there be any man that thinks, that our God may inspire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, the iustice of examining causes; and deny it to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of priestes assembled in a councell.

               </p>
               <p>By this historie we may learne manie things. First, that the pope was not then acknowledged supream head, &amp; that <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> &amp; the whole church of Aphrica knew no such superioritie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, that the holie spirit is not tied to any one man, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to the Pope: but that it is present in all countries, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the church, to decide all controuersies, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> also witnesseth;<note place="margin">De praescrip. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. pag. <hi>99.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>that Iesus Christ, being taken vp into heauen, doth sit at the right hand of his father, and that hee sent <hi>(vicariam vim spiritus sancti: qui credentes agat)</hi> the power of the holie ghost, as his Vicar, in his roome: which shoulde leade the faithfull.</hi> And thirdlie, that this course was then obserued in all causes: First the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane dealt in the matter; if the partie grieued would not standt to his iudgement, he might secondlie appeale to a prouinciall; and lastlie to a generall councell. And that was the last refuge, there was an ende. <hi>4.</hi> They tell the bishop of Rome, that if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the councell of Nice had béene otherwise: yet he shoulde obserue that which he knew to be true, according to that wisdome God had giuen him. <hi>5.</hi> They séemed to appeale to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in the matter, that God had ordained no such authority in his worde. <hi>6.</hi> They call the authoritie hee challenged, worldlie pompe. <hi>7.</hi> They touch pope <hi>Zozimus,</hi> of forgerie and pride. <hi>8.</hi> They say, Christs church sheweth to all men, the light of simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6236:140"/> and humilitie, in all her doings: and so on the contrarie, that <hi>Zozimus</hi> dealt craftilie and proudlie. <hi>9.</hi> They thought then, that the pope might erre in those daies. <hi>10.</hi> They shewe, that neither the councel of Nice, nor anie other councell, had taken this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue from the church of Aphrica, nor from anie other: but that she might end all her controuersies at home, without appealing to Rome. <hi>11.</hi> They call the bishop of Rome brother. Here is the true copie of the councell of Nice, the testimonie of <hi>217.</hi> bishops, the practise of the church; strong arguments and reasons, against the popes supremacie: and yet shall anie man be so wilfullie blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he will not sée and acknowledge all these? Here is that craft which <hi>S.

               <p>But yet to make the matter more plaine, least anie shoulde thinke perchance that all these were partiall in their owne cause: you shall heare the plaine testimonie, as concerning this matter, of <hi>Gregorie;</hi> who was bishop of Rome himselfe,<note place="margin">Greg. lib. <hi>4</hi> Epist. <hi>91.</hi>
                  </note> when as <hi>Iohn</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Constantinople, because the imperiall seat was there, (as it seemed) puffed vp with pride, by that meanes tooke occasion to preferre himselfe before other bishops, and to be called vniuersall bishop: <hi>Gregory</hi> being then bishop of Rome, writeth to him after this maner: <hi>Mark I beseech thee, how in this thy rash presumption, the peace of the whole church is troubled, and thou resistest or spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest against the grace, which is giuen to all equally or commonly. In which thou maiest so much grow, as thou shalt in thy selfe decrease: and thou shalt become so much great, in as much as thou shalt bridle thy selfe, from the vsing of the name of pride, and of a foolish worde: and so much thou shalt go forwarde, in as much as thou shalt not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to thy selfe, by derogating from thy brethren. Loue therfore (deere brother) humilitie with thy heart, by which the concorde of all bishops, the vnitie of the whole vniuersall church may bee kept. Truly the Apostle S. Paul, when he heard some say: I am of Paul, I of Apollo, I of Cephas; trembling wonderfully at this tearing in peeces of the Lordes body, by which, the members thereof do ioine themselues, as it were to other heades; cried out saying: was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul? If hee
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6236:141"/> therefore eschewed, that the members of the Lords bodie should be particularly subiect to any certaine or other heads, beside Christ; no not to the Apostles; what wilt thou answere to Christ, the head of the vniuersall church, in that strait accompt of the last iudgement, who goest about, by the name of vniuersall bishop, to put all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers vnder thee? who is followed as an example, in this froward word? but hee, who despising the legions of angels, ioined fellow-like with him, endeuored to break vp to the top of singularitie; that he would be subiect to none, and alone woulde seeme to bee aboue all. What are all thy brethren, the bishops of the vniuersall church? but starres of heauen, whose both liues and tongues among the sinnes and errors of men, as it were in the darkenes of the night, do shine. To whom while thou doest couet, by a worde of pride to prefer thy selfe, and to tread vnder their names in comparison of them, what saiest thou else, but I will ascende vp to heauen, and I will set my throne aboue the starres?</hi> And after: <hi>Truely Peter is the first member of the holie and vniuersall church; Paul, Andrew, and Iohn; what are they, but heades of particular peoples? And yet they are all members of the church, vnder one head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere wee may plainlie see, by <hi>Gregories</hi> testimonies these pointes. First, that all bishops were brethren, were equals: and that by the name of vniuersall bishop, he thought, that the peace of the church was troubled; and that by this equalitie rather of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, then by anie supremacie of anie one of them, the vnitie and peace of the church, was kept and maintained. Secondlie, that by this name, the grace of God, which was giuen to all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops equally, was gaine saide: as though God had giuen to one Bishop, who should bee the vniuersall bishop, more grace, then to the rest. This (saith <hi>Gregorie,</hi>) is to denie the grace of God, to be giuen to all alike. This he then affirmed: and the papistes now denie. Thirdlie, that Christ is onelie the vniuersall heade of his church, and that all his members are to bee put vnder to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no not of the Apostles, and then not to <hi>Peter;</hi> but to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: much lesse then to the Pope. And doth not the pope yet, now challenge this? Fourthlie, that hee is like Lucifer, that challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that superioritie, who being fellow with the angels, would be aboue them. So are all bishops as starres equall, and that no one ought to set his throne aboue the rest; who so doth, followeth Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers example. And doth not the Pope so nowe? Lastlie, that <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:6236:141"/> himselfe, was but the first member of the church; because he first confessed Iesus Christ openlie;<note place="margin">As <hi>S. Paul</hi> cals him a pillar ioining him with the rest: so doth <hi>Gregory</hi> heere.</note> and not an vniuersall head or Christes vicar, as the pope now challengeth. He was called first in order, of the Euangelistes: because when as one reckons vp manie, there must néedes be one first in order. One may do two thinges at once, as God when as he created heauen and earth, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne noteth vpon <hi>Genesis:</hi> but one cannot speake two thinges at once; but one must be named before y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other. So was <hi>Peter</hi> named first in order, not in honor: herein they were all equall, as <hi>Cypriā</hi> also herein with <hi>Gregorie</hi> agréeth.<note place="margin">De simplic. praelat.</note> And to make the matter more plaine; <hi>Paul, Andrew and Iohn</hi> are heades: but particular heads; no vniuersall head, but one Iesus Christ; in respect of whome, all are members, and are vnder him. This is <hi>Gregories</hi> opinion most manifestlie.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer, our owne histories proue the same. <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> bishop of Rome himselfe, wrote to <hi>Lucius</hi> our first christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an king here in Englād, that he was Gods vicar here, in this his kingdome. And that he néeded nothing but Gods word, and lawes made agréeing with the same, to gouerne his people by: whose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the king is yet to be séen in the records of the Guild-hall in London, as <hi>Stowe</hi> in his late chronicle reporteth.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> eccle. hist.

But <hi>they answered that they would aske counsell of their brethren.

                  <hi>first of all refused his election; and affirmed, that the Emperor had no authoritie to chuse him: but he was chosen by his clergie, and by the people.</hi> And if this his saying were true, that the Emperor had no right to chose the bishop of Rome: then all the former bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were not lawfullie elected, and were no lawfull bishops but vsurpers.

And is not this a strange thing, that so manie good bishops, before that time should be vsurpers? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the beginning the Emperour chose the Pope: but now the Pope chuseth the Emperour: Is not this a great alteration? This their owne histories testifie, and yet they will grant no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the church: they demand of vs, when this alteration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Thus all men maie sée, howe they haue plainelie denied the only master of his house, the onelie head of his Church, the only husband of his wife, Iesus Christ, according to <hi>Saint Iudes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.

They preached the word of truth, and they begat sonnes, not to themselues: but to him. To this belongeth the mysterie of the lawe: If the brother shall die, let the brother take his wife, and raise vp seede to his brother. Christ is dead, he is risen againe, he is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he hath absented himselfe in his body, his brethren haue taken his wife, and by the preaching of the gospell, are about to get chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not by themselues; but by the gospell, for the name of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore raising seed to their brother, those whom they begat, they named not Paulians or Petrians: but Christians.</hi> Here first Christes absence with his bodie taketh awaie their reall presence in the sacrament. Secondly, if christians maie not be called Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians or Paulians, then not Dominicans or Franciscans. The brother must beare the name: therefore all Christes séede must be called Christians. Here maie be noted, that christians tooke their name of Christ, as he was called the annointed, and not as hee was called Iesus; because all were partakers of his annointing of the holie ghost: but as he was called Iesus, in the office of his saluation, none were ioined with him: and therfore in those daies, none were called Iesuites. This name is a newe and vsurped name. And a little after: <hi>In thy honour, kinges daughters haue delighted: the daughters of kinges, the daughters of the Apostles:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:6236:143"/> but in thy honour, because they raised that seede to their brother. Yea those which he had raised to his brother, when Paul sawe them runne to his name, he cried out, was Paul crucified for you? What saith the lawe, let him that is borne, haue the name of the dead, let him be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of him that is dead. This point of the law Paul kept, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contrarie to that master Harding writs: The church of Rome is the vniuersall church: is the onely church of God.</note> And after: <hi>behold Rome, behold Carthage, behold diuers other cities, they are kinges daughters: and they haue delighted their king in his honour, and of them all is made one Queene.</hi> Why then, the church of Rome (by <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgment) was not then accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the catholique church. She was but a member of the church. She, with the rest of her sisters, made that one Quéene, that one catholique church, that one spouse of Iesus. And after he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the garments of this Quéene; <hi>And what</hi> (saith he) <hi>be the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Queene? It is pretious, it is diuers: The mysteries or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the doctrine,<note place="margin">Saint Austen here makes the Aphrican tongue no barbarous tongue.</note> in all, in diuers toongs. There is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Aphrican toong, the Syrian toong, the Greeke toong, the Heb. toong, and diuers other toonges. These toongs make the diuersitie of the garments of this Queene. But as all the diuersitie of the garments, agreeth in one: so all these toongs are to one faith: In this garment there is diuersitie: there is no rent: there is no diuision.</hi> So that the scriptures were then, in all languages. And this was the garment of diuers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours most glorious, which the church then ware: but since that time, the Pope hath changed her coate: she goeth nowe in a coate of one colour, all must be in latine, in his kingdome. This gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diuers colours, he cannot abide. In <hi>Augustines</hi> daies the came clothed in a garment of diuers colours, but in vnitie of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It was the same golde, the same wisedome, in all these tongues, as he there saith.</p>
               <p>And as he describeth the husband, the person, the vesture of this Quéene: so he describeth her beautie also. <hi>The king</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath greatly desired this beautie. What beautie? but that, which he made. He hath desired thy beautie, what beautie? of a sinner, of one that is vniust among her owne people? No, but that whereof it is said, who is this that ascendes, being made white? Before therfore, she was not white: but afterward she was made white.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Thou art married to God the king; being endowed of him, being beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him, being redeemed of him, being healed of him. What soeuer thou hast, by which thou pleasest him, thou hast it of him.</hi> Thus <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> also condemnes their frée will. We haue no goodnesse, not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:6236:143"/> a droppe of our selues; no beautie, not a sparke: but from him. And after he describes the state of the Church. <hi>The daughters of Tyre, shall be there with their giftes. The king commeth</hi> (saieth he) <hi>and he will haue giftes. But what giftes, almes, &amp;c.</hi> And also he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes her gouernours. <hi>For fathers</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou shalt haue sonnes. The Apostles haue begotten thee: but can they be alwaies in body present? No, one of them said, I desire to be loosed, and to bee with Christ, Therfore by their departure, is the church forsaken? God forbid. For fathers, thou hast sonnes borne to thee. And what is that? The fathers are gone, that is, the Apostles: and for the fathers, sonnes are borne to thee, Bishops are constituted.</hi> So that in the Apostles place, Bishops succéeded, and they gouerne the church throughout all the world. And this is the catholique church, (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) sons borne to the church, whome she shall make princes ouer all the world: that is, Bishoppes gouerning the church throughout all the world: This is the Catholique Church, saith he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also teacheth vs the same faith of the Greeke church, concerning this matter, in his daies.<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>20.</hi> ad Popul. Ant.</note> Speaking of the Emperours loue towardes the citie of Antioche, hee saith thus: <hi>Haue I not euer preferred this citie before all others, and accounted it more deere then my countrey?</hi> If Rome had béene the catholique church, the Emperour had béene too blame, to haue preferred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche before it. And of the Emperour himselfe, after in the same Homilie, thus hee writes: <hi>Oh howe great is the power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: the man (meaning the Emperour) vppon earth, hauing none equall vppon earth vnto him, hath bridled and restrained his power, of destroying and ouerthrowing all thinges, and hath taught such Philosophie, as a priuate man woulde not haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Truely great is the God of the christians, which maketh of men Angels, and setteth them aboue the necessity of mans nature.</hi> If the Pope had béene aboue the Emperour, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> had béene both a lyar, and a flatterer, in preferring the Emperour before him: which I trust, no true catholique will affirme. And after: <hi>In this also, the city hath not a little honoured their king, when as they sent no embassadour vnto thee. For they gaue a most excellent and honourable speech of thee,<note n="*" place="margin">Qui omni principatui tuo subiectos Dei sacerdotes prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoras.</note> that thou honourest very greatly all the priestes of God, which are subiect to all thy dominion, and principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though they be neuer so simple.</hi> If priestes were not subiect to the Emperors rule and gouernment, this had béene a false spéech,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:6236:144"/> which the whole cittie of Antioche had giuen of him. One maie perchance make a lie: but it is not likely, that a whole citie should make a lie. Here the Romish catholiques maie sée, howe manie liars they must néedes make, if they will maintaine the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, either of their Pope, or of their Rome. First the Emperor, <hi>2.</hi> then <hi>Chrysostome, 3.</hi> then the whole citie of Antioch. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Homilie,<note place="margin">Hom. 18.</note> thus he writeth of the citie of Antioche. <hi>Thou art sorie that the worship of the citie is lost. Learne what is the worship of the cittie: and then thou shalt surely know, that if the inhabitants doe not betray it, no man else can take away the worship of the citie: Not that it is the mother citie, nor that it hath stately buildings, nor many pillars, and porches, and walkes, not that it is commended before other cities: but the vertue, and religion of the inhabitantes; these are the worship, and ornaments, and defence of the citie.</hi> And a little after: <hi>What is the worshippe of our citie? It chanced first at Antioche that the disciples were called christians: This priuiledge, of all the cities that be in the world, none hath. Neither that same citie of Romulus, for this cause may looke aloft, against all the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she hath the fire of the loue of Christ; for this trust, for this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> See here howe he preferreth plainlie Antioche before Rome, and he calleth it <hi>Romulus</hi> citie, as it were in contempt, in respect of Antioch: which he would not haue done, if he had beleeued that Rome had béene his mother church, as our catholiques now teach. No doubt <hi>Chrysostome</hi> would haue spoken more reuerentlie of his mother. And after he concludeth, <hi>that although Antioche were in some displeasure, with the Emperour: yet hee hoped, that shee should resume her former countenance, and bee in her former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Emperors authoritie also, agreeing with <hi>Chrysostome, Tertullian</hi> writes thus: <hi>We worship the Emperour</hi> (saith he) <hi>so as we may, and as it is expedient for him, as a man next to God, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he is, hauing obtained of God, lesser then God alone. This also he willeth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apol. ca. 30.</note>
                  <hi>For so he is greater then all others, when as he is lesser, then the onely true God.</hi> And in another place: <hi>The Emperours knowe who gaue them their Empire: They knowe what are men, they perceiue who are soules or spirits, that he is God alone, in whose power they are alone, from whom they are second, next whom they are first, afore all and aboue all Gods.</hi> And after: <hi>Moderating the maiestie of Caesar vnder God, I commend him more to God: to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:6236:144"/> whom alone I make him subiect. I put him vnder, to whom I doe not make him equall.</hi> Thus we maie see plainlie, by thrée euident testimonies, that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> daies, the christians beleeued that the Emperour in this world, was the next man to God. For thus he writeth in their apologie or defence, in the person of them all. And after: least anie should thinke, hee flattered and had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the danger that followeth flatterers, thus he writeth.<note place="margin">Cap. 34.</note>
                  <hi>If flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie be not ashamed of lying: yet let it feare cursing.</hi> He speaketh of those flatterers which called the Emperour a God. <hi>Ferus</hi> also writeth thus vpon the <hi>6.</hi> of <hi>Iosuah. By this also</hi> (saith he) <hi>is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there are three orders necessary in the church. In the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are the secular princes: these must go before, and make a waie for the priestes with the Arke: And therefore armour is permitted vnto them. In the second order, are the priestes, and to these belong not weapons but the trumpet, and the arke. For none is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to the faith with armour; but by preaching of the word: and they which are the Lordes souldiers, must not entangle themselues with secular affaires. In the thirde order, are the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they must obey the secular power and heare the priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> also in an Epistle he writes to <hi>Casulanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. 86.</note> concerning the fast of the Iewish Sabaoth, or our satterdaie, that we ought not then to fast, declareth his opinion of the authoritie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church of Rome. It should séeme that the Church of Rome, fasted on the sabaoth, and that this <hi>Vrbicus,</hi> against whome he writes, vrged this authoritie of the church and Bishop of Rome, for his defence, to whome <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth thus: <hi>In this opinion</hi> (saith he) <hi>he blasphemeth the church dispersed ouer the whole world, except the Romaines and a fewe westerne churches. But</hi> (he saith) <hi>it is certaine, that the life of the sheepe</hi>

                  <hi>depend of the iudgment of their pastors. But wo to them that call good euill, and euill good. &amp;c. What mean these wordes saith Augustine, I cannot tell: for if as you write, Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicus saith thus, the people depending of the iudgement of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, doth fast with their Bishop on the sabaoth day; If he haue writtē these things thus vnto you, because in your Epistle you haue put such a like matter: let him not perswade you, so to praise a Christian city fasting on the sabaoth, that you may be compelled to condemne the whole christian world, that day dining. For when as he saith wo to them that call good euill, and darkenesse light, &amp;c. meaning the fast on the sabaoth to bee good, light and sweete; and the dining on the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:6236:145"/> sabaoth day, to be euill, darkenesse and bitter: who doubts but that he condemnes the whole world, in all christians, dining on the saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth?</hi> Here wee maie see plainlie, that <hi>Augustine</hi> counted Rome, but a Christian citie, and not the whole church; nor that the bishop of Rome with his Church,<note place="margin">Videant Romani quid faciant, <hi>saith he.</hi>
                  </note> could or ought to preiudice or controll the whole world, though he fasted on the sabaoth daie.</p>
               <p>But that, which followeth in <hi>Augustine,</hi> makes the matter more plaine. <hi>If</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) it be answered, that Iames taught those at Ierusalem &amp; Iohn at Ephesus, and other in other places, that Peter taught at Rome, that is, that they should fast on the sabaoth day; and that other countries haue erred from this doctrine, and that Rome continued in it: and on the contrary it is replied, that some places of the west, amongst which Rome is, haue not kept that, which the Apostles haue deliuered; and that the countries of the east, from whence the gospell began to be preached, haue continued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained without any varying, in that which was deliuered of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and also of Peter himselfe, that they should not fast on the saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth: This is a contention without end</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) engendering quarrels, not ending questions.</hi> So that here by <hi>Augustines</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the church of Rome maie erre, euen in kéeping of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas the Catholiques at this daie saie, she cannot erre. And that to appeale to her, as to an vndoubted piller of truth, or to anie one church, either of Ierusalem, or anie other, is as a contention without end. And after hee calleth <hi>Rome the seate of the most famous Empire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierom.

It should séeme that deacons were preferred before priestes, amongst certaine in those daies, being lead by the custome of the church of Rome; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which matter <hi>Ierome</hi> writes thus: <hi>Neither must we thinke</hi> (saieth hee) <hi>the church of the citie of Rome, to bee one; and the Church of the whole worlde to bee another: as though Rome should controll the whole church.</hi>

                  <hi>Or</hi> (as the Glosse also expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the same place) <hi>that the custome of the church of Rome is to bee taken necessarily for an example. The Churches of France, of Brittaine, and Affrica, and Persia, and the east countrey, and India, and all barbarous nations, worshippe one Christ, obserue one rule of truth: If we respect authority, the whole world is greater, then a city.</hi> Here we maie see plainlie, the church vniuersall distinguished frō the church of Rome, in boundes and lymites, and also in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6236:145"/> And also of the Bishoppe of Rome, and of Constantinople, and of Alexandria (whome he makes all equall concerning their offices, and priesthood, or bishoprickes) he writes thus: <hi>Whersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a Bishop shal be, either at Rome, either at Eugubium, or at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, or at Regium, or at Alexandria, or at Thanis: he is of the same desert, he is of the same priesthood.</hi> That is, <hi>he is all one.</hi> And he addeth, <hi>what makes them seeme greater?</hi> For some might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: Is the Bishop of Regium in Sicilia, or of Thanis Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane of Egypt, as good, and of as great power as the Bishop of Rome? <hi>Ierome</hi> answereth,<note n="a" place="margin">Potentia diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum &amp; pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertatis humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</note>
                  <hi>The power of riches, and the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of pouerty, makes a Bishop either higher or inferiour. But they are all, successors of the Apostles.</hi> So that then, all Bishoppes are equall concerning their offices. They succéede the Apostles all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, euen the Bishop of Rome with the rest. But they are higher by reason of their riches and power: and that also aduanced the Romaine Bishoppe, not anie authoritie or preheminence from Christ or <hi>Peter.</hi> And after hee obiectes, <hi>But you say, Howe at Rome are priestes made at the testimony of Deacons? Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, What bring you me the custome of one citie? What the fewnesse (that is) of Deacons, whereof this pride is sprung vppe? Thou encrochest against the lawes of the church.</hi> Here wee maie plainlie see, what account <hi>Ierome</hi> makes of the church of Rome, how he accountes it but the church of one citie: and how he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the vniuersall church against it; and howe he makes the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, equall with other Bishops. And in another Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, he preferreth Bethlem before Rome:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>And I thinke</hi> (saith he) <hi>speaking of Bethlem, that this place is holier, then the Rocke of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia, (meaning Rome) which is often reported from heauen that it hath been striken with thunder boults, because it displeased the Lord. Reade the reuelation of S. Iohn, and marke what is said there, of the woman cloathed in purple, and of the blasphemie written in her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.

And loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe to Ieremie, marke also howe it is written, flie out of the middest of Babylon, and euery man saue his owne soule: for great Babylon is falne, it is falne, and is become the dwelling of deuils, and a cage of euill spirites. There is there truely, the holy church; there is there, the ensignes of the Apostles and Martyres; there is there, the true confession of Christ; there is there, the faith commended of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:6236:146"/> Apostles; and Paganisme troden vnder foote, the name of christians euery day aduancing it selfe on high: but ambition it selfe, the power and greatnesse of the citie, to see and to be seene, to salute and to be saluted, &amp;c. are far off, and not conuenient for the purpose of Monks.</hi> This is <hi>Ieroms</hi> plaine iudgment concerning Rome. Here hee plainlie confesseth, that the church of Rome maie erre: Nay that it shall be that Babylon, <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> speaketh of, and of the seate of Antichrist. He toucheth their monasteries and Celles, calling it out of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> a cage of vncleane spirits, and also the crueltie of the Pope and his cleargie, affirming, that it is become not a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of pastors: but a dwelling of deuilles. Now the Deuill was a murtherer from the beginning, as our sauiour teacheth vs. Now such deuilles haue a long time dwelt in Rome, as who séeth not? He acknowledgeth the priuiledges of Rome, their faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of the Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (as it should séeme) dying there, and planting the faith there euen with their bloud. But yet for all this, he thinkes that Rome shall degenerate, shall become Babylon: naie euen then in his time, in her greatest glorie, hee accountes Bethlem holier then her. What can be more plainer then this? vnlesse anie one will wilfullie shutte his eies, against the truth. Who will venture his soule nowe, vpon the church of Rome, of which <hi>Ierome</hi> thus writes?

                  <note place="margin">Epist. 3.</note>Of the supremacie <hi>Ignatius</hi> writes thus: <hi>Some</hi> (saieth he) <hi>call their pastor by the name of Bishop, and doe all things without him.

And of the authoritie of euerie Bishop in his seuerall Diocesse, he writes thus to the <hi>Magnesians: It becommeth you to obey your Bishop, and to gainesay him in nothing. For it is terrible thing, to contrary him. For a man despiseth not him, whom he here seeth: but they despise him, that inuisible one, which may not be despised of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For he is not promoted to this dignity of man; but of God. For so saith God to Samuell of his contemners: they haue not despised thee; but me.</hi> And after: <hi>Let vs all loue together in concord, and let no man consider him that hath the charge of him after the flesh: but according to Iesus Christ. Let there be no cause, that may moue you

Therefore let nothing seeme reasonable vnto you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his sentence; for that is vnlawfull and odious.</hi> And of the vnitie of the Church, hee writes thus to the <hi>Philadelphians, Wherefore I write to you boldly in God, to your worthie charity, exhorting you, that you continue in one faith, in one preaching, vsing one gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes: for there is one flesh of our Lorde Iesus Christ, and one bloud, which was shedde for vs, and one bread broken for all, and one cuppe of the whole church, and one Bishoppe together with presbyters and deacons my fellow seruants, because also there is one only not begotten God the Father, and one only begotten sonne God the word and man, &amp; one comforter the spirit of truth, one preaching also, and one faith, and one baptisme, and one church, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles haue founded from one ende of the world to the other, in the bloud of Christ, with their owne paines and labour. And it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth you, as a priestly people, and a holy nation, to be perfected all of you in the vnity of Christ.</hi> Here we maie note, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> would haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church vse one manner of giuing of thanks, nor to change that, which then was vsed; which, by the papists own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, since his time hath béene changed.

Where it is also to be noted, that he faith, there is one cuppe of the whole church: The cuppe was giuen to all in his daies. And that there is one Bishoppe in euerie Church, as there is one God, and one onely begotten son Iesus Christ, and one holie Ghost. For thus he writes not of the Bishoppe of Rome, but of the Bishop of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, whome he calles his fellow seruant: and that there is one church through the whole world, planted by the Apostles, not at Rome onelie: and that all the saintes must bee consummated and vnited in Christ as in their head. Here séemes to be the whole summe of Christian religion, briefely knitte vp together: from faith and baptisme, the verie first entrance of Christian religion, to Iesus Christ the heade and finisher of the same. And againe: <hi>Let no man without the Bishop doe any thing, of those things which concerne the church, of ecclesiasticall matters. Let the Eucharist be

And he is the steward of all the spirituall nature. Wherefore it is not lawfull without the Bishop, neither to offer, nor to sacrifice, nor to celebrate Masse. If it shall seeme good to him, according to the pleasure of God: then it shall be safe and sure.</hi> And after: <hi>No man is more excellent then God, nor like to him, nor more honourable then the Bishoppe in the church, exercising the priesthood to God, for the saluation of the world.

And so vnitie may be kept in all pointes.</hi> Here we maie plainly see, in Gods affaires, in ministration of the sacraments, in preaching the word; he makes the bishop in euerie congregation in Christs stéede: and he willes all men to obey his precepts, out of the word of God, euen as Christ obeyed his father. In the host and in the common wealth, he giueth the superioritie to the prince. In the host (saith he) who is like to him? He giueth not both the swordes to the Pope, as the Church of Rome nowe imagineth. So that not anie one Bishop ouer the whole world, but euerie Bishop in his Church, is Christes Vicar, by <hi>Ignatius</hi> iudgment.

                  <hi>The deuill found out heresies and schismes, wherewith he might subuert faith, breake in sunder the truth, and cut in peeces vnitie. Those whom he coulde not detaine with the blindnesse of the olde way: hee hath beguiled and seduced, with the error of the new way. He snatcheth men frō the church her selfe, and whilest they seeme to themselues to come neare to the light, and that they haue escaped the night of the worlde: hee againe powreth other darkenesse to the ignorant; that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, with the Gospell of Christ, and with obseruation of it, and the lawe, they might cal themselues christians; yet walking in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they shoulde thinke themselues to haue the light, (the enemie flattering &amp; beguiling them): Who according to the saying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, hath changed himselfe into the likenesse of an angell of light, and doth set his seruants out, like seruants of righteousnesse, affirming night for day, destruction for saluation, desperation vnder a pretence of hope, falshood vnder the color of faith; Antichrist vnder the name of Christ, that whilest thinges seeming true, are counterfeited, they might make frustrate the truth with subtletie. This is done hereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethrē) whilst that we return not vnto the beginning of truth, nor seeke the head, neither in that we keepe the doctrine of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly master, which if any would consider and examine, there need no long discourse or argumentes. The triall vnto the faith, with the compendiousnesse of the truth, is easie. The Lord speakes vnto Peter, I say vnto thee</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not ouercome it. I will giue to thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and what thou shalt bind vpon earth shall be bound in heauen also, And whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth shall bee loosed in heauen.</hi> And to the same he saith after his resurrection: <hi>Feed my sheep. And although he gaue like power to all his Apostles, after his resurrection, and saide; as my father hath sent me, I also send you, receiue ye the holy Ghost; whose sinnes ye shall remit they shall bee remitted vnto him; whose sinnes ye retaine, they shall bee retained: Notwithstanding that hee might make manifest vnitie, by his owne authoritie, he hath disposed the originall of the same vnitie beginning of one. And the selfe same thing truely were the other Apostles that Peter was, indued with the like fellowshippe both of honour and power: but the beginning sprang from vnitie, that one church might bee shewed. Which one
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:6236:149"/> church also the holie ghost in the Canticles, in the person of the Lord, doth meane and say: One is my Doue, my perfect one, shee is one, chosen to her mother. Doth he beleeue that he holds the faith, which holds not this vnitie of the church? He that striues against and resistes the church, doth he trust that he is of the church?</hi> Here we may see by <hi>Cyprians</hi> iudgement, why Christ spake to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, not to preferre him before the other Apostles; but to declare the vnity of the church: which should be one through the whole world: Which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie who holds not, is none of Christs. This vnitie was common among all bishops: For thus he writes to <hi>Cornelius, Those things especiallie we do, and ought to bee carefull of: that the vnitie giuen vs of the Lorde and his Apostles, as much as wee can, we maintaine.</hi> This vnitie was not giuen to <hi>Cornelius</hi> or his successors; but to the whole church; nor by <hi>Peter</hi> onelie, but by all the Apostles. <hi>2 lib.

For in euery perfect man, hauing the congregation of those wordes, deedes, and fences, which fulfill blessednesse, is the church, which is builded of God. But if you doe thinke that the whole church is builded vpon that one Peter only, what will you say of Iohn the sonne of thunder, and of euery one of the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? But otherwise, shall we be bold to say, that the gates of hel shall not preuaile against one Peter: and that they shall preuaile against the other Apostles, and perfect men? And not rather in all and euery one of them, of whom it is spoken before, that is done which is saide: And the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it? And also that vpon this rocke will I builde my church. Or truely were the keyes of the kingdome of heauen giuen to Peter onely of Christ? Nor that anie of the other blessed Saintes receiued them also? But if this saying, I giue to thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, bee
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:6236:149"/> common also to the rest: why then not also all thinges, both those which were spoken before, and also those which follow, (as it were spoken to Peter) are common to all? For heere, and that seemed to bee spoken as it were to Peter: Whatsoeuer thou shalt binde vppon earth, shall be bound in heauen; and the wordes that follow. But in S.

                  <hi>they took not to themselues the glory of this primacy, but they ordained Iames, which is called iust, the bishop of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> Here we may plainelie see, by the mouthes of two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> first that not onelie <hi>Peter;</hi> but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>S.

But all these quarrels, two notable powers, running out of the same lystes (as it were) brought to concord and vnitie: whereof one was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Rome, gouerned by the authority of one: The other was the doctrine of Christ, which two began both at one time to florish to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And as the power of our Sauiour tooke away the manie kingdomes of the Diuell, and his diuers worships of many gods, and preached one God to Greekes and Barbarians, and to all others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the ende of the worlde: So the Romaine Empire, hauing taken away the causes of many Empires, hath put vnder her iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all kingdomes that man coulde attaine to: and hath taken great care, that all mankinde should bee knit together in bondes of peace and concorde, &amp;c. For now as children begotten of one father, that is of our God; and of one mother, that is, of true religion, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue imbraced peace among themselues, and haue kept it from time to time, that from that time the whole worlde doth differ nothing from a familie, gouerned and knit together, with good lawes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:6236:151"/> and ordinances. So that now euery one may at his pleasure, trauell where he will, without perill and danger. Eusebius</hi> placeth the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church in the vnitie of religion, neither placeth hee one spirituall Monarke, ouer the church: as hee doth one temporall, ouer the common wealth.</p>
               <p>But some will obiect, that the Fathers attributed much to the Apostolique seaes. It is verie true: but yet they accounted no one of them, ladie or mistresse ouer all the rest, as appeareth by <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. 55.</note> who writes thus: <hi>That most mighty Champion of our faith, hath fenced his church with famous assemblies, of all people, and nations (meaning generall councels) with the seaes Apostolique, as with towers of authority: and also with strong and inuincible reasons of the godly and learned.</hi> Where he preferreth councels, before the apostolique seaes. And after also concerning the apostolique seaes,<note place="margin">Epist. 42.</note> he writes thus: <hi>You see</hi> (saieth he) <hi>howe many are cutte off from the christian society, which by the apostolique seates and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of Bishops, by most certaine propagations, is spread ouer the whole world.</hi> No one apostolique sea, was the whole church, no not Rome her selfe, by <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgment: but by them, all the Church was begotten, and spread ouer the whole world; they were mothers or rather midwiues vnto it. Of a vine the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh:<note place="margin">Psal. 80.8.</note>
                  <hi>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it. And when it had taken roote, it filled the land.</hi> This vine is, no doubt, the Catholique Church of Christ, the Lord himselfe brought it out of the spirituall Egypt, of sinne and ignorance, by sending his holie spirit. The Apostles and all the apostolique seaes, were but planters of this vine: as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Paul hath planted, and Apollo hath watered; but God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the encrease:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.6.</note>
                  <hi>so that neither he that plants is any thing, or he that waters, but God that giueth the encrease. He that planteth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth is all one,</hi> that is, in effect is nothing: <hi>But God is all in all.</hi> Nowe shall we saie, that anie of these planters of this vine, is anie thing, is the vine it selfe? That were to gaine saie the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.<note place="margin">Io. 3.29.</note>
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the baptist said of Christ, and of himselfe: <hi>Hee that hath the bride, is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome standes by, and heareth him; and reioiceth greatly at the voice of the bridegroome; and this my ioie is now filled:</hi> Euen so we maie saie of the apostolique seaes, and of the vniuersall Church. None of them was the bride, but they were all handmaides, waiting on
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:6236:151"/> the bride; and they all reioice at her glorie, and their glorie is fully perfected, seeing her spread ouer the whole world. None of them dare presume to take her person vpon her, no not Rome her selfe: if she doe, she is <hi>Agar,</hi> she is a rebell against her ladie &amp; mistresse. And of these apostolicall seaes, Rome was not the first in order (as appeareth) till <hi>Iustinians</hi> daies. And here we may marke, how his sea by little and little, crept vp to her supremacie:<note place="margin">Part. <hi>2</hi> Tit. <hi>16.</hi> Ca. <hi>1.</hi> prima sedes dicebatur quae a nemine iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caretur.</note> First it was thought, that the first sea should bee iudged by none of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seaes.

                  </hi> And here we maie note by the waie, what certaintie it is, to builde our faith on the fathers, when as <hi>Ierome</hi> saith plainlie, <hi>that Rome shall bee that Babylon, which S.

                  <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> in his argument of <hi>Tertullians</hi> booke of prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against heretiques, writes thus of <hi>Tertullian: That Christ whilest he was here on earth, taught aboundantly whatsoeuer was necessary. And that he chose twelue disciples, whome after his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he commanded to goe, that they might teach the Gentiles.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:6236:152"/> And those Apostles, first ordaining churches in Iewry; after that, they went into all the world; and that they ordained churches in euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which were called apostolique churches, from which all the rest, (as it were) borrowed their doctrine. Furthermore, that there was</hi>

                  <hi>one chiefe apostolique church, from which sprang all the rest. He</hi>

                  <hi>appointes this to no one place.</hi> Let vs marke, howe <hi>Tertullian</hi> here affirmes, that Christ taught all thinges aboundantly, while he was here on earth. And therefore, left nothing hereafter to be taught, as new and strange doctrine, by the holie ghost, which he himselfe had not taught before. Secondly, that there is one chiefe apostolique church. But this, <hi>Tertullian</hi> fasteneth or tie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h to no one place. Why then not to Rome? And after: <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> writes his owne iudgment. <hi>As by this booke it may plainly appeare to the reader, if he be not very simple, by what meanes the bishop of Rome hath come to this authority, which at this day hee hath. Although Tertullian doe highly commend the Romane church: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he makes not so great account of her, as we see is made at this day. For he reckons her among the other apostolique churches. He doth not make her the onely apostolique church,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Summatem facit non summā.</note>
                  <hi>he makes her one of the chiefest, not the chiefest of all. And he writes to the same effect, in his fourth booke against Marcion in these wordes: To be briefe, If this be certaine, that that is truest which is first; and that first, which was from the beginning; and that from the beginning, which was from the Apostles: then also it shall be manifest, that was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Apostles, which was kept as holy of the apostolique chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Let vs therefore see, what milke the Corinthians sucked from Paul, by what rule the Galathians were reformed againe, what the Philippians, Thessalonians, and Ephesians doe reade, what also the Romaines, our next neighbours doe found foorth, to whom Peter and Paul left the gospell, sealed also with their owne bloud. We haue also the churches, Iohns schollers, &amp;c. If Tertullian were aliue nowe, he would hardly say thus, without punishment.</hi> Thus much <hi>Beatus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi> plainlie writeth, of the authoritie which the Fathers gaue to the Romaine church. And hee not onelie affirmeth; but prooueth his assertions substantiallie, out of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> And now who will not beléeue these two witnesses, and condemne rather the church of Rome, with <hi>Renatus,</hi> then <hi>Tertullian?</hi> who if he were aliue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and wrote thus, <hi>Renanus</hi> affirmes would nowe condemne him. <hi>Aeneas Siluius,</hi> who was after Pope, confesseth; <hi>that before

                  <hi>he hath reserued in euerlasting chaines, vnder darknesse vnto the iudgment of the great day. As Sodome and Gomorrha, and the cities about thē, which in like maner, as they did, committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and followed strange flesh, are set forth for an example and suffer the vengeance of eternall fire.]</hi> Here we maie see, how the Apostle still vrgeth vs to kéepe the first faith, howe hee not onely teacheth and commandeth it: but goeth about to prooue it, and as it were to enforce it, by manie examples, of the people of Israell, of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, of cities: That all those that kept not their first estate or calling, which left their first house or dwelling, that afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued not, that committed fornication and went backe againe: God hath seuerely and for our examples apparantly punished. And here first, as it is apparant, that those abominable sins, which I must touch hereafter, of vncleannesse of the flesh, of fornication and worse, of couetousnesse, of pride, and blasphemous inuasions of the honour due to the immortall God, and his son Iesus Christ our most blessed sauiour; raigned in the time of the darkenesse of Poperie. So herein, as the false teachers and wicked seducers, (the Pope and his spiritualty) are iustly to be blamed. So I must néedes confesse, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Laitie who like simple shéepe, were through the craftinesse of their teachers misled, and kept from the booke of God, neither were so déepe in these sins, neither are to be thought, through the mercy of God, so déepe in their condemnation. Christ was not only in Iewry,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.13.</note> but also in Egypt: to declare, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ouer all the worlde, euen in that same spirituall Egypt. And therefore,<note place="margin">Apoc. ca. 11.8.</note> to go forward with these examples <hi>S. Iude</hi> giueth vs here to marke, we maie see, (if wee bee not ouermuch blinded with partialitie) thrée chiefe sinnes of false catholiques, and of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie touched and painted out. Their supremacie vnder the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Lucifer, their vnbeliefe to that great promise of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by their pardons, dyrges, masses, and such like, added as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie thereunto, vnder the example of the Israelites: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:6236:153"/> their wicked sinfull liues, vnder the example of the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites: whose sinnes were reported to be common among them. Lucifer in the beginning, was created an angell of light; but he was not contented with his estate, hee would be aboue other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, he would be like to God himselfe; and therfore he was for his pride throwen downe to hell: So the Bishop of Rome was a chiefe pastor, was like Lucifer among the angelles of God, and ministers of his church: but he was not content with his estate, but he would be aboue them all, so that he would be like the sonne of God: he would be his vicar and vicegerent. Nay aboue him, in dispensing with the written word of God, which Iesus Christ neuer tooke vpon him, who came to fulfill his fathers will, and not to breake it. And is not he plainlie another Lucifer? Euery one that hath eies maie sée this: let him in the ende, looke for his great pride, for Lucifers fall. The Israelites were mightelie deliuered out of Egypt, frō the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> They had a promise of the land of Canaan; but after this their deliuerance,<note place="margin">Num. 13.31.</note> in going to the land, they doubted of this promise, as we maie reade in the booke of Numbers; and so they all perished, and died in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse: Euen so God hath deliuered vs from the bondage of that spirituall Pharaoh the diuell, by our baptisme, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vs that celestiall Canaan, through faith in his sonne Iesus Christ: If nowe we shall not beleeue his promise; if we shal adde our owne deuises to it, our own reason; as though God were not able to make his worde good, as the Israelites did:<note place="margin">Gen. 13.10.</note> shall we not likewise perish? Sodome was like the garden of Eden, euen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other paradise; but they followed strange flesh, and they were burnt, with fire and brimstone from heauen. And were not our Monasteries such like? In situation most pleasant, and in sinne (as was suspected) most abominable. So then let vs knowe and marke that proude Lucifer of Rome, let vs beléeue assuredlie the promises of God, what gyant soeuer of deuils or huge bulwarks, or walled townes, of sinne be against vs. Let vs marke wisely this Sodome. Let not the pleasantnesse thereof beguile vs, nor the statelie buildinges thereof, nowe on the grounde, pittie our hearts: but let vs acknowledge their sinnes, and detest those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, which were the cause of their desolation. Let all these examples warne vs, and as it were arme vs, least being taught so plainly by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostle, and warned so plenteously, if we contemn
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:6236:154"/> all these, we perish worse then they. This is the summe of these verses. So that then we are to remember, to meditate vpon, and as it were to raminate or chewe ouer againe these two pointes: That the first faith is the true catholique faith: and that there shal craftely créepe in a second faith: which is false and counterfeit, and which we must all fight and striue against. This is the whole sum of this Epistle. And these two pointes like nailes with manie strokes, the Apostle seemes to fasten in our hearts: and therfore let vs marke well that we be not deceiued.</p>

And after: <hi>Away with this sworde that killeth men, my sworde which I haue committed to thee, cutteth off vices, saues the men.

                  <hi>looking for and hastning to the comming of the day of God?</hi> We should by our workes declare our selues, as though we greatlie desired that daie, as though we would euen run to méet it. Euery daie hath his proper workes. The scripture teacheth vs what workes belong to the daie of iudgment:<note place="margin">Mat. 25.35.</note>
                  <hi>To feede the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, to giue drinke to the thirstie, to harbour the harbourles, to cloth the naked, to visit the sicke, to go to prisoners.</hi> These workes we should doe with all speed, and so we should as it were make haste to that daie. These are the workes which at that daie shall be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for at our hands; shall be allowed of in our accountes; shall
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6236:165"/> be crowned of our mercifull and mightie king. These the iudge himselfe, who cannot lie, who would haue all his ready and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hath foretold vs. And what can be more louingly done to vs then this? that the iudge should tell one what he should doe or saie, before hee commeth to the barre. Our iudges maie not doe it, they maie giue no counsell: but this great iudge of his excéeding great loue towardes vs, hath done it: and oh foolish men, who wil not followe his counsell, who regard it not, who nowe this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawing neare, will doe quite contrarie. These dearthes of corne which we haue had of late, this dearth of wooll and cloth, these rents raised of houses in all places: are but trialles of vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this great daie of God, what we will doe: whether we had rather fill our purses, or feede the poore; whether we had rather for lacke of rent, turne the poore out of doores, or else haue patience with our brethren; and if our tenants be not able to pay vs, looke for our rent at Iesus Christes handes: whether wee had rather clothe our selues with our wooll money, and hang the walles of our houses; or the liuelie walles of the temple of Iesus Christ? The most men hope and wish corne will be deare, and hourd it vp, they will sell none yet, that they maie fill their purses, they wil not sell to the poore, much lesse relieue the néedie. The landlordes inhaunce their rents, that the poore cannot reach to them, and so doe not harbour them; but as much as in them lieth, turne them out of dores: naie they inhaunce their rentes so, as the tenant is not able, both to paie his rent, and maintaine his familie. And this is the chiefe cause, why hospitalitie decaieth so in our daies, especiallie in great lordshippes, which should bee as it were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads to relieue the whole towne. Their rents are so great, that the tenantes of them are not able to giue anie almes, or reliefe. And is this to haste to the daie of the great God? Is this to follow our iudges counsell? Is this to haue faith? This is plainlie to saie in déede, there shall be no iudgment. For if they beléeued it, they would prepare themselues against it.</p>

                  <hi>that euery one may receiue according to those things hee hath done in his body, either good or euill.</hi> Wherein euerie word hath his force: First in that he saith <hi>(we must)</hi> there can be no excuse, God will pardon none. All, euen euery one, euen kings
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6236:165"/> and others that be in authoritie and nowe iudge others. <hi>(Be made manifest:)</hi> not onely make appearance, as we doe in our courtes oftentimes, and then depart: but all the corners of our heartes, all our workes, all our secret thoughts, all our imaginations and priuat practises (which we keepe close in the bottome of our harts, as the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saieth, and which wee would haue no man knowe) shall then be made manifest, euen as cleare as the sunne, to the eies of all men: And that not before a friend, which would couer and cloake their faultes; but before the tribunall seate of a most terrible iudge, at whose presence heauen and earth quaketh: who is now come <hi>to render to euery man according as he hath done.</hi> Oh therefore, let vs nowe take héede what wee doe, let vs studie nowe to please him, that at that daie we maie be accepted. <hi>Wee knowing this feare of the Lord, saith the Apostle, this terrible day of iudgment: we doe perswade men</hi> that they do good,<note place="margin">2.

                  <note place="margin">2.

Then Moses went downe from the Mount vnto the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes: and he said vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Be ready on the third day and come not at your wiues. I thinke (saith Brentius) that from this place our ancestors consecrated to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and abstinencie the sixt day and the Sabaoth: that on the next Lords day y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people might come pure and prepared to heare the law of God. The superstition of daies is to be misliked; yet this preparatiō and instruction is necessarie, that men may be made more fit to heare the worde of God: we sowe no seeds in the earth vnlesse we plough before, &amp;c.</hi> And surelie it is to be feared that for lacke of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, the seede of Gods word, which is so painfullie and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie sowen in all places, at this daie, taketh so small effect &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth so ltitle fruite. Men come to heare the word of God on the sabaoth daie with vnprepared heartes. It is a seede sowen on land that is not plowed; and can the seed then be it neuer so good, bring forth anie fruit?<note place="margin">Trem. in cap. <hi>29.</hi> Exod.</note> And <hi>Tremelius</hi> vpon the same place writes thus: <hi>Nowe altogether applie your selues, that you may be instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                  <hi>This question (saieth Tremelius) is drawn from the Analogy of the commandement Exod. 19.15. and of the Oracle of God, of which mention is made hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the tenth verse, and in the chap. following verse 10. As though hee would say, they which will vse most holie thinges, such as these loaues of bread are: must be endued with that purenesse, which God requireth of them that come nigh to him, and now also he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</hi> They which heare the worde of God, or participate his holie sacramentes, by <hi>Tremelius</hi> iudgement grounded by that place of <hi>Exodus,</hi> should abstaine euen from their lawfull pleasures, euen of meates and drinkes, euen from their wiues, before they come to be guests of the Lordes table. But I feare me that before wee come to the Lordes table, either to eate the bread of his worde, or of his sacraments, this washing our garments, this fasting, this abstaining from our wiues is neglected.</p>
               <p>In Hebrew, fasting is called <hi>Tsom,</hi> deriued by transposition of letters, of <hi>Mots,</hi> that signifieth to sucke out:<note place="margin">Dan. 10 2.</note> and surelie so it may verie trulie.

                  <hi>that thou didst set thy heart to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and to humble thy selfe before God, thy words were heard.

And that by the same meanes Saint Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard gat all his learning, whereas hee was but a little while brought vp at schoole. And that by the benefit of fasting and abstinence, S.

And S. Basill that most famous preacher, and most eloquent and wise Oratour and Deuine, that euer was in the world: yet in clothing himselfe and sleeping hee was most abstinent. He couered his naked bodie but with one gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he slept alwaies on the ground; nay rather hee watched al night, and continued in holie exercises. All these doctours beeing so excellent in wisdome, were no lesse famous for their abstinencie, then for their wisdome.

And comming from praier, hee had that as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which he should vtter as if he had learned it in some booke. And no doubt he ioined fasting to his praier and mercie.

                  <hi>Our Sauiour which had no neede to fast, fasted, that he might giue vs an example. For then a man declares that hee would obtaine that which hee desires, when hee punisheth himselfe with fasting. And hereof it is saide, that praier is good with fasting. Therfore that praier may be acceptable, it wil haue with it as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:6236:167"/> fasting. And because neither of these is sure, without pittie: he addeth, And almes with righteousnesse.</hi> So great is the force of fasting. If wee would then knowe the secret mysteries of God, let vs fast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basil</hi> also of fasting verie excellentlie writes thus. <hi>As much as thou shalt take from thy flesh:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Basil. ser. <hi>2.</hi> de ieiunio.</note>
                  <hi>so much shalt thou adde to the liuelie force of thy soule: and the Angels who are appointed keepers of our soules, doe more willinglie and carefullie keepe those which by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting are purified. Nay, there are angels in euery church and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, marking and registring those that doe fast. Take heede therefore least thou be punished for thy short pleasure of thy meate, and least thou make thy selfe guiltie to the Angell the Lordes Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as a runnaway from the Lordes armie. Surelie it were lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for one to throw away his shield in the field, then to slacke to take in his hands the great weapons of fasting. Art thou a rich man? despise not fasting: vouchsafing to bid it to dinner with thee, and make it thy guest, least thou make thy house wherein pleasure and belly-cheere beareth the rule, vile and worth nothing; least thou thy selfe also smart for it, at that Lawgiuers hands, and pay deerely for thy ryot: greater troubles being iustlie laid vpon thy backe, either by some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie sicknesse, or by some other grieuous mischance. Againe, if thou beest a poore man, do not thou despise fasting, when as now thou hast fasting, as thy bedfellow, and thy daily companion. Fasting is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to women, euen as the ayre they breath, and that euen by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Children as young plants, must be watered with the water of fasting. And the olde acquaintance of fasting maketh it seeme lesse laborious to old men.</hi> What can be said more forcibly to perswade all meen to fasting? Angels note in euerie parish who be good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. But some will saie perchance, this is but <hi>Basils</hi> opinion. But I saie more, and that out of the gospell: that euen God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe notes and markes those that fast. Doth not our sauiour say?<note place="margin">Matth. 6.17.</note>
                  <hi>But when thou fastest, annoint thy head, and wash thy face: that thou seeme not to men to fast, but vnto the father which is in secret: and thy father which seeth in secret, wil reward thee openly.</hi> Surelie I feare me nowe, that neither God nor Angels see anie fast. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to fast: for <hi>Basil</hi> saith that Angels register those that fast. And our sauiour saieth, that euen God himselfe seeth them, and knoweth them euerie one, and will reward them.</p>
               <p>And againe, he writes thus:<note place="margin">Basil ibidem.</note>
                  <hi>Doest thou not see how horsebrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:6236:168"/> and masters do tame their horses first, and make them nimble by fasting? But thou euen of set purpose, doest so with fulnesse presse downe and spoile thy selfe, that in gluttony thou goest beyonde the bruite beastes. A full bellie is not fitte for a race, no not to sleepe quietly, because being ouercharged with heauinesse, it causeth vs not to be quiet, but to tosse ourselues hither and thither. Fasting preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth children, it maketh young men sober, it maketh olde men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and reuerende, it is the fittest ornament for women, a bridle for them that be lustie and healthfull, the safe keeper of wedlocke, and the nurse of virginity. This is the care, that abstinencie hath in euery particular family. But common abstinence gouerneth our whole life, it bringeth euery citie &amp; people to a good state, it stilleth all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and braules, it rootes out suites, it controwleth all reproches and reuilings: Euen as the masters presence stilleth the noyse of children; so fasting bridles the sturres of cities. Who euer came wanton or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate from fasting? What company was euer out of order, that vsed fasting? nice scoffings, wanton songes, madde merriments, straight way depart the citie, beeing banished of fasting, as of a seuere iudge. And if all men would vse this in all their affaires, as a counseller; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, nothing could hinder but that quiet peace shoulde bee thorow the whole world.</hi> Here are excellent commodities of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, singular commendations and ornamentes to euerie age: nay peace to our common wealth. And no doubt all those troubles which are now so common amongst vs, arise for want of fasting. The well fed horse, can abide no spurre: so they which delicatelie féed themselues can endure nothing; they will bee reuenged for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie little iniurie.

                  </hi> which nowe they call Halspurge, <hi>so famous with the petigrees of so many kings and Emperours. The Bishop hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the castle was built, comming to his brother when as he saw that the building thereof was very rude and weake; first he began to wonder at the folly of his brother, and after to demaund an account of him of his money.

In the meane while the same night, he commanded all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men and country men his neighbours, whose landes and seruices hee had redeemed and set free, with his money: to bee ready in the morning armed, as though they would assault the castle. The Bishop not knowing what the matter meant, amased with the sight of such a multitude, as though they had beene his enemies; was tolde of his brother, that those were his walles of yron, which he had bought with his money.</hi> I would to God our great builders would make such walles to their houses. Such walles would please God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their builders more surely, then anie walles of stone. But we build now adaies, or care for few such walles.</p>
               <p>But some will saie, is it not lawefull to builde then? Surely thereis a time for all thinges, <hi>A time to breake downe,</hi>

               <p>The like may be said of purchasing and buying land. Men were neuer so giuen to purchase and buy land, as at this daie. What

So that without all doubt, the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> are come vpon vs: And this prophesie of our sauiour is most euidently ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in our eies. And it is to bee feared, least that as at the first comming of our sauiour, the Iewes hauing a plaine prophesie, <hi>that when the scepter should depart from Iudah, then Messias should come;</hi> yet they were so blinded with worldlie ambition, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this prophesie was cleerelie fulfilled, that they would not sée nor marke it, and so perished in their blindnes: so at the second comming of our sauiour, least we, hauing also this plaine prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie that <hi>our daies shall bee like the daies of Noah,</hi> and we sée the same manifestly fulfilled, shall bee like them carried awaie with the course of the world; and also perish in our ignorance and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse.

Let them that bee godly wise, marke well; least while they followe their steppes, they perish in their destruction. Let the course of the world beguile no man: That because others doe so; therefore we maie doe the like.

And in another place he concludeth: <hi>that all mouthes must be stopped, and the whole world must be subiect,</hi> that is, must yéeld themselues as guiltie, <hi>to the condemnation of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> No man must bragge of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:6236:180"/> his workes, or challenge anie merit before the maiestie of God. The workes which the Pharisie did,<note place="margin">Luke 18.11.</note> were good workes, <hi>as to fast, to pray, to pay his tithes:</hi> but he bragged of them, he trusted in them, he confessed not, <hi>that he was an vnprofitable seruant,</hi> hee looked not for, he desired not the mercie of God, for his saluation: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was reprooued. For who amongst men, will bragge of that, which is not his owne? And such like are our good workes: They are none of ours; they are the free giftes of God. <hi>Hee hath wrought all our workes in vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Es. 26, 12. Ephes. 2.10.</note> saith the Prophet. And againe, <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>we are his workmanship, being created in Christ Iesus to good workes, which God hath prepared before, that wee should walke in them.</hi> Here is a second creation in Iesus Christ, <hi>to good workes:</hi> so that they wholy belong to Gods grace. Mans nature of it selfe, can challenge no part of them. Therefore it hath nothing to brag of, as concerning them: Nay we being regenerate haue not so much of our selues, as of our selues, <hi>as to thinke a good thought,</hi> or to deuise a good worke. For it is said also, <hi>that God hath prepared them long before, that we should walke in them.</hi> And therfore <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> writeth thus verie excellently,<note place="margin">In Enchirid. ad Laurent. de fide cap. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> and manifestly concerning Gods frée mercie, and mans frée will. <hi>Againe</hi> (saieth he) <hi>least anie man should brag, although not of his workes, but of his free will, as though desert had his beginning of that, to which the reward of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well as due, should be requited; let liberty her selfe, euen the freest man in the world, heare the preacher of grace, saying: It is God that worketh in you, both to wil and to worke, according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> And in another place: <hi>Therefore it is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth: but it is of God, that hath mercy.</hi> And after he expoundes this thus against our Semipelagianists, that ioine grace and nature together: <hi>If it be said, It is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God shewing mercy; because it is of them both, that is both of the will of man, and mercy of God, that we should thus vnderstand it to bee meant: It is not of him that willeth, or of him that rūneth, but of God shewing mercy; as though it should be said, the wil of man alone sufficeth not, if the mercy of God be not there also; nor the only mercy of God, if the will of man be not there also. And in this sense, if it bee well said so, that (it is not of man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but of God shewing mercy,) because mans will alone is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring it to passe; why may it not then on the contrary, be as wel said, It is not of God shewing mercy, but of man willing; because the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:6236:180"/> mercy of God alone also, doth not bring it to passe? Therefore if no christian dare say, It is not of God shewing mercy, but of mans wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, least hee should most manifestly speake against the Apostle: it remaines, that therefore it is truely saide, It is not of man willing or running, but of God shewing mercy; that all may be yeelded to God, who prepareth mans good will, that it may be helped, and helpeth it also being prepared. Mans good will goeth before many of the gifts of God; but not all: but those which it doth not go before, it is among them it selfe.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Augustine</hi> most plainly writing of the christian faith to <hi>Laurentius,</hi> not disputing earnestly against <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius;</hi> and so by heate of disputation, caried ouer much to speake in the commendation of Gods grace, to depresse the pride of mans nature, as some haue written: And his opinion is grounded vpon the scripture so firmely, as all the enemies of Gods grace, shall neuer be able to ouerthrow it. But most manifestly in his booke of Retractations he taketh away this obiection &amp; friuolous cauil. For first he retracts nothing out of this booke <hi>ad Laurentiū de fide.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Ret. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>

                  <hi>Behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>how long before the Pelagian heresie sprang, we haue so disputed, euen as though we had disputed against them.</hi> So that <hi>Augustine</hi> neuer changed his opinion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was of the same mind before <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his heresie was hatched: as he was also after. So that then <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion is cleare, that man of himselfe, can challenge no part of merit, for his good workes: and that God when he crownes our good works, crowneth his owne giftes. Man must therfore ascribe all his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation wholie to God, and no part thereof to himselfe.

                  <hi>That is, to God onely wise, our sauiour, be glory and maiestie, and dominion and power, both now and for euer, Amen.]</hi> This place also prooueth that our sauiour is God, and he addeth two other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, why we should giue him praise: because he is the wisedome of God, he hath declared God vnto vs, which was in the bosome of the father.<note place="margin">Io. 1.18.

And shal we not praise, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie this our gratious, and mercifull, and louing, and most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God and sauiour? Let vs therefore yéeld to him, all maiestie, and magnificence: as doing things wonderfull, passing all mans reach and reason. Let vs giue him glorie and praise for these his wonderfull workes, let vs yeelde to him dominion, and empire, in this world ouer all Turkes, Tyrants and wicked christians: nay ouer all the deuils of hell,<note place="margin">Psal. 135.6.</note>
